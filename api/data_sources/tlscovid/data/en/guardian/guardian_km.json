        "news": "Here is the full story on Twitter labelling Trump’s false claims with a warning for the first time. The Guardian’s Julia Carrie Wong reports from San Francisco with Sam Levine in New York: Twitter for the first time took action against a series of tweets by Donald Trump, labeling them with a warning sign and providing a link to further information. Since ascending to the US presidency, Trump has used his Twitter account to threaten a world leader with war, amplify racist misinformation by British hate figures and, as recently as Tuesday morning, spread a lie about the 2001 death of a congressional aide in order to smear a cable news pundit. Throughout it all, Twitter has remained steadfast in its refusal to censor the head of state, even going so far as to write a new policy to allow itself to leave up tweets by \"world leaders\" that violate its rules. The company’s decision on Tuesday afternoon to affix labels to a series of Trump tweets about California’s election planning is a result of a new policy debuted on 11 May. They were applied – hours after the tweets initially went out – because Trump’s tweets violated Twitter’s \"civic integrity policy\", a company spokeswoman confirmed, which bars users from \"manipulating or interfering in elections or other civic processes\", such as by posting misleading information that could dissuade people from participating in an election.",

Florida issued its new rules after recording a startling 8,942 new cases of Covid-19, the respiratory illness caused by coronavirus, eclipsing the state’s one-day record of 5,511 reached on June 24. California Governor Gavin Newsom said Friday that Imperial County, east of Los Angeles, has become so overwhelmed by the virus that the state was recommending it issue a strict new stay-at-home order.

        "news": "Latinos in California are becoming ill and dying from Covid-19 at far greater rates than other groups, the state’s top health official has warned, prompting new outreach and data collection efforts as cases surge. Latinos make up 39% of the population in the US state, but account for 56% of Covid-19 infections and 46% of deaths, the California health and human services secretary, Dr Mark Ghaly, said. Of particular concern is the heavily Latino Central Valley agricultural region, where cases continue to soar and hospitals are becoming overwhelmed even as the rate of new infections may be slowing in the state overall, Ghaly said. Experts said a perfect storm of workplace issues and cultural traditions in the Central Valley has led to a crush of cases that has devastated many families. Many Latinos in the Central Valley are poor, working in industries such as agriculture that have been deemed essential during the pandemic. Many employers have not reliably provided protective equipment to workers or implemented social distancing or rules requiring masks to be worn, measures essential to containing the virus, state officials say. In addition, cultural norms that foster large family gatherings and include many multi-generational households have led to fast and deadly transmission of the virus, often to older relatives who are less able to survive. On Tuesday, Ghaly said California would implement a new method of tracking Covid-19 as well as other infectious diseases by requiring labs to ask the ethnicity, sexual orientation and gender identity of those they test. Also of concern is a high death rate for African-Americans who contract the disease, although progress has been made lowering the group’s overall infection rate, Ghaly said. African-Americans make up 6% of California’s population and account for 4% of Covid-19 infections but 8.5% of deaths, he said. Whites, who make up 37% of the population, account for 17.5% of cases and 30% of deaths, state data show.",

        "news": "Florida has surpassed 500,000 coronavirus cases as testing ramps up following a temporary shutdown of some sites because of Tropical Storm Isaias. A long line of cars waited outside Hard Rock Stadium in Miami Gardens on Wednesday morning for a coronavirus testing site to reopen after being closed because of the storm. Florida reported 225 new deaths on Wednesday, bringing its seven-day average of daily reported deaths to a high of 185, behind Texas with 197. Florida’s rate is approaching a quarter of that seen in New York at its peak in mid-April. The number of people treated in hospitals statewide for the coronavirus continued a two-week decline, with 7,622 patients late Wednesday morning, a decrease of 175 from the previous day and down from highs of 9,500 two weeks ago. The Florida Department of Health reported 5,409 new coronavirus cases on Wednesday. Overall, Florida’s reported 502,739 cases ranks second to California, with more than 527,000 cases, and above Texas with more than 466,000, according to Johns Hopkins University. The Hard Rock site briefly shut down on Wednesday because of lightning in the area. Testing resumed once the weather cleared. Florida governor Ron DeSantis this week announced that quicker testing, with results in about 15 minutes, would be offered at the stadium and at Marlins Park. \"Obviously if you are somebody that is symptomatic and you don’t get your result back for seven days that is not helpful. For asymptomatic test takers, if it takes seven days then the test is basically useless at that time,\" DeSantis said.",

        "news": "Several large US states including Texas are not heeding new federal health officials’ calls to reduce Covid-19 testing of some exposed to the virus, joining a broad rebuke of the Trump administration by public health leaders. Arizona, California, Connecticut, Florida, Illinois, Texas, New Jersey and New York all plan to continue to test asymptomatic people who have been exposed to Covid-19, despite new guidance from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) suggesting that such tests may not be needed. \"The current Texas guidance recommends testing for all close contacts of a confirmed case because it allows for early case identification among people who are at a higher risk of infection,\" a spokesman for the Texas Department of State Health Services in a statement. \"There’s not a planned change at this point.\" California and New York made similar statements. The Florida Department of Health said asymptomatic testing was continuing while the new CDC recommendations were evaluated, and Texas also said it would evaluate. The CDC said this week that people exposed to Covid-19 but not symptomatic may not need to be tested, shocking doctors and politicians, and prompting accusations the guidance was politically motivated. Even before the CDC guidance, coronavirus testing in the US had dropped. The US tested on average 675,000 people a day last week, down from a peak in late July of over 800,000 people a day. Nationally, cases have fallen for five weeks in a row but infections are surging again in the US Midwest with four states reporting record one-day increases in cases on Thursday as the US death toll climbed above 180,000. The CDC had previously recommended testing of all people who had close contact with someone who was diagnosed with Covid-19. New York governor Andrew Cuomo said the state of New York would not be abiding by the new guidance and challenged the assertion that politics played no role in the change. \"This 180-degree reversal of Covid-19 testing guidelines is reckless, and not based on science and has the potential to do long-term damage to the (CDC’s) reputation,\" Cuomo said in a joint statement, along with the governors of New Jersey and Connecticut, who also said their states would not be following the CDC’s guidance. Admiral Brett Giroir, the assistant secretary for health at the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), said there was no political pressure from the administration. He said that testing asymptomatic patients too early could produce false negatives and contribute to the virus’s spread. CNN and The New York Times reported on Wednesday that US public health officials were ordered by high-level members of the Trump administration to push forward with the changes. CDC director Robert Redfield issued a statement on Thursday that \"everyone who needs a Covid-19 test, can get a test,\" but \"everyone who wants a test does not necessarily need a test.\" Globally, many nations advocate early testing. The World Health Organization on Thursday said, that resources permitting, people exposed to the coronavirus should be tested even if they do not show immediate symptoms of infection. European governments have used broad testing and isolation to control the virus. France, for instance, recommends that anyone who thinks they need a test should get one and in Germany, people with close contact of 15 minutes or more with a person with Covid-19 are advised to have a test.",

Covid-19 deaths reached 3,253 on Wednesday, pushing up the US total since the start of the pandemic to 289,740. A record 106,219 people were hospitalised with the highly infectious disease, threatening to overwhelm many healthcare systems. Healthcare professionals and support staff, exhausted by demands of the pandemic, have been watching patients die alone as millions of Americans refuse to follow medical advice to wear masks and avoid crowds and smaller gatherings to contain the virus’ spread. In California’s San Joaquin Valley agricultural region, less than 2% of intensive care unit (ICU) beds remain unoccupied, the California Department of Public Health said on Thursday. The number of available ICU beds continued to drop throughout the most populous U.S. state, with just 7.7% availability in the heavily populated southern California region.Nursing home residents and staff have also felt the burden. \"This is a pandemic that no one has ever experienced in our lifetimes,\" Stephen Hanse, president of the New York State Health Facilities Association and the New York State Center for Assisted Living, told Reuters on Thursday. The one-day death toll exceeded the number of lives lost on 9/11, underscoring the human toll and the call for Americans to redouble efforts. \"No Christmas parties. There is not a safe Christmas party in this country right now,\" Dr. Michael Osterholm, a member of president-elect Joe Biden’s Covid-19 advisory board, told CNN on Thursday. It won’t end after that, but that is the period right now where we could have a surge upon a surge upon a surge. More than half of US states have recently introduced or resumed restrictions to try to curtail the rampant spread of the virus. On Thursday, Virginia’s governor Ralph Northam imposed a midnight-to-5 am curfew among other measures that will kick in on Monday and last through at least 31 January. \"Case numbers have been rising for weeks, they’re higher now than they’ve ever been during this entire pandemic, Northam told a news briefing. Providing a ray of hope, a vaccine could start reaching healthcare workers, first responders and nursing home residents within days in what Hanse called \"light at the end of the tunnel.\" A panel of independent medical experts was due to decide later on Thursday whether to recommend that the US Food and Drug Administration authorise emergency use of a vaccine from Pfizer Inc and German partner BioNTech SE. FDA consent could come as early as Friday or Saturday, followed by the first US injections on Sunday or Monday, Moncef Slaoui, chief adviser to the Trump administration’s Operation Warp Speed vaccine development program, told Fox News.

        "news": "In the US, Dr Anthony Fauci, the country’s top infectious diseases expert and a key member of the White House coronavirus task force said on Sunday that the economy in parts of the country could have a rolling reentry as early as next month, provided health authorities can quickly identify and isolate people who will inevitably be infected with the coronavirus. Dr Anthony Fauci also said he can’t guarantee\" that it will be safe for Americans to vote in person on Election Day, 3 November. Fauci said the process will be gradual and based on the status of the pandemic in various parts of the US, as well as the availability of rapid, widespread testing. \"Once the number of people who are seriously ill sharply declines, officials can begin to think about a gradual reentry of some sort of normality, some rolling reentry,\" Fauci said. In some places, he said, that might occur as soon as May. But whenever restrictions ease, Fauci said, \"we know that there will be people who will be getting infected.\"Social distancing guidelines imposed by President Donald Trump are set to expire 30 April. Trump is eager to restart the economy, which has stalled because most Americans are under orders to stay at home to help slow the virus spread. But other senior US public health officials have pushed back on Donald Trump’s eagerness to reopen the country quickly, as a senior World Health Organization (WHO) figure warned that Covid-19 \"is going to be a virus that stalks the human race for quite a long time to come\":",

        "news": "Oliver Milman, an environment reporter for Guardian in New York, has some analysis on the progression of the coronavirus pandemic in the US. A model relied upon by the White House, from the University of Washington, estimates that the virus will \"peter out\" in May and then essentially grind to a halt by the summer. This is based on the experiences of China and Italy, previous coronavirus hotspots. But this model, like all predictions, is dynamic and depends upon the application of measures such as social distancing to slow the rate of transmission. Other forecasts have been more pessimistic, warning that it will be difficult to tame the spread of the virus until well after summer. Premature relaxation of restrictions on gatherings of people could see a second, much more severe, increase in infections. The sheer size of the US, as well as its large population, means that there will be several ‘peaks’ at different times across the country. While the situation may be starting to stabilize somewhat in New York, areas in the heart of the country have yet to see the worst of the virus.\"That is going to be confusing for people,\" said Doug Burgum, governor of North Dakota. \"If wow, New York had all these deaths and they are opening up, why aren’t we opening? That will be a communication challenge for us, but we have to just keep monitoring and see where we are going on this.\"",

Andrew Parker who was the director general of MI5 until two and half weeks ago, told a webinar: I’m just not aware of any evidence that it is anything other than what people think it is: It came via markets. There are all sorts of hypotheses around, but I just think it is not useful to speculate, worry about all that. The former British spy chief said it was the business of intelligence agencies to find out if there was ever a point when a state or non-state actor was trying to deliberately spread a dangerous disease. In that case, he said, there \"should be an expectation that the agencies will somehow uncover that\". But, in remarks that could have been addressed directly to the US president Donald Trump or the secretary of state Mike Pompeo, Parker concluded: Conspiracy theories right now are not helpful. Both Trump and Pompeo have publicly pushed the lab leak theory without offering supporting evidence. British intelligence agencies have been saying for the past couple of weeks they don’t subscribe to the lab leak theory, although the idea is nevertheless being pushed in news media in the UK, US and Australia.

        "title": "FDA revokes emergency use of malaria drug Trump touted as coronavirus treatment",
        "news": "The US Food and Drug Administration has revoked its emergency use authorisation for hydroxychloroquine to treat Covid-19, the drug championed by president Donald Trump. Based on new evidence, the FDA said it was no longer reasonable to believe that oral formulations of hydroxychloroquine and the related drug chloroquine may be effective in treating the illness caused by the coronavirus. The move comes after several studies of the decades-old malaria drug suggested it was not effective, including a widely anticipated trial earlier this month that showed it failed to prevent infection in people who had been exposed to the virus. The drug’s anti-inflammatory and antiviral properties suggested it might help treat Covid-19, and the FDA authorised its emergency use in March. While it did appear to neutralise the virus in laboratory experiments, hydroxychloroquine, which is also used to treat lupus and rheumatoid arthritis, has failed to prove its worth in human Covid-19 trials, thus far. In March, Trump said hydroxychloroquine used in combination with the antibiotic azithromycin had \"a real chance to be one of the biggest game changers in the history of medicine,\" with little evidence to back up that claim. He later said he took the drugs preventively after two people who worked at the White House were diagnosed with Covid-19, and he urged others to try it. Doctors in recent weeks had already pulled back on the use of hydroxychloroquine as a Covid-19 treatment, after several studies suggested it is not effective and may pose heart risks for certain patients. France, Italy and Belgium late last month moved to halt the use of hydroxychloroquine to treat Covid-19 patients. But the United States last month supplied Brazil with 2m doses for use against Covid-19, as the South American country has emerged as the pandemic’s latest epicenter. Meanwhile, some 400 trials are listed as using hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine as interventions for Covid-19, more than half of them still ongoing, according to a recent analysis from research firm GlobalData. In the United States, the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases last month launched a trial designed to show whether hydroxychloroquine in combination with azithromycin can prevent hospitalisation and death from Covid-19.",

We’re getting a little more now from the press conference (given online, not in person) by the Chinese foreign ministry. The government has been at pains to emphasise that it has the tools to control the spread of this coronavirus outbreak, but this morning did concede it needs help – in the form of protective medical equipment. \"What China urgently needs at present are medical masks, protective suits and safety goggles,\" the foreign ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying said in a press briefing on Monday morning. China’s factories can produce 20 million masks a day, but panic over the virus has prompted people in the country of 1.4 billion to stock up on them, while frontline medical personnel have reported equipment shortages. Agence France-Presse provides this context: At full capacity, China’s factories are only able to produce around 20m masks a day, according to the ministry of industry. The foreign ministry said countries including South Korea, Japan, Kazakhstan and Hungary had donated medical supplies. Tian Yulong, of the industry ministry, said earlier on Monday that authorities were taking steps to bring in masks from Europe, Japan and the US, adding that supply and demand in China remained in \"tight equilibrium\" as factories returned to production after the lunar new year break. He said they were now operating at between 60% and 70% capacity. In addition to Hubei, the province of more than 50 million people at the centre of the outbreak, several other provinces and cities across China have made it compulsory to wear masks in public. These include Guangdong – China’s most populous province – plus Sichuan, Jiangxi, Liaoning and the city of Nanjing, with a combined population of more than 300 million.",

        "news": "We’re learning more about this coronavirus each day, but a month since it emerged, there remain some important holes in our understanding — what the former US secretary of defence, Donald Rumsfeld, might have called known unknowns. I’ve just spoken to Ian Mackay, a virologist at the University of Queensland about what some of those might be. The disease appears to spreading more efficiently than its cousins Sars or Mers. That’s probably down to the fact that the world is much more dense and interconnected than in 2003, when Sars emerged, and because this coronavirus is more easily transmitted. \"It’s more like the flu, which can whip around the world in no time,\" says Mackay. It appears that China will not be able to contain its spread within the country, but that doesn’t necessarily mean the death toll will spike, he says. \"One big hole in our understanding is whether the disease is more dangerous than Sars,\" he says. \"That part is hard to answer because we’re missing a big important number, which is how many people are confirmed cases but haven’t gone to the hospital and are being quarantined at home, and how many have recovered.\" That matters, because it will tell us how many people have gotten only mildly or moderately sick, and therefore how deadly the disease is. If we take the cases that have been reported outside China, the death rate is less than 1%. But understanding the full spectrum of infections inside China will give us a much better idea. \"Usually with respiratory viruses we see the young end of town as the virus spreaders,\" says Mackay. Think of the way that kids go to school, spread a cold, then take it home to their parents, who in turn might carry the virus to work. \"So I’m wondering why we’re not seeing kids among the cases,\" Mackay says. He speculates it might be because we’re focusing on the most severely infected people, who are presenting to hospital, and missing the fact that many people, including children, might have the coronavirus but are only presenting with relatively minor symptoms and recovering at home. Viruses are \"relentless replicating adaptive machines\" that are constantly evolving, and this coronavirus will be no exception, Mackay says. Virologists need to see a larger selection of genome sequences of the virus than are currently available \"to see more of what’s happening with the virus as it’s passing through thousands, possibly tens of thousands of hosts\". Chinese officials have made comments suggesting that the virus is now transmitting more easily. Scientists will want to see evidence of those new cases \"just to make sure that there aren’t consistent changes building up in the virus over time that might have an effect\" on how it should be fought, he says.",

        "news": "A drop in the number of new coronavirus cases for two days is good news, says the director general of the World Health Organization. However, he cautions against reading too much into it. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said the numbers could go up again, but the last two days were showing a declining trend. There were roughly 3,900 new cases reported worldwide on 5 February, 3,700 on 6 February and 3,200 on 7 February - the vast majority in China, WHO figures show. At the Science Media Centre, Paul Hunter, professor in Medicine at the University of East Anglia, said: Over the last two days we have actually seen the first of two consecutive declines in the number of new cases, which is nice, but whether that is sustainable or not we will only know in about a week or so. The infection, like most droplet-spread infections, tend to spread more in winter than in summer, so it’s quite plausible that even if the spread does continue, at least in the northern hemisphere we will see a decline during the summerThe big question then will be whether it reappears in November as we move into the traditional flu seasons where these sorts of viruses ... tend to predominate. Ghebreyesus also reported that in response to his appeal earlier this week for more countries to share information about the outbreaks in their countries, not all nations had provided the requested information. \"There are some countries who have yet to send detailed case reports to WHO,\" he said. \"We urge those member states to share that information immediately.\"",

        "news": "Travellers from China face up to six months in jail and a maximum fine of HK$25,000 (£2,491) for breaching quarantine measures, Hong Kong’s government has announced. At a press conference on Friday, the chief secretary, Matthew Cheung, said the 14-day mandatory quarantine for visitors arriving from mainland China is expected to reduce the number of people crossing the border. People involved in cross-border logistics and workers essential to government services would be exempted from quarantine but monitored closely. From Saturday, people entering the city will be required to sign a document consenting to the quarantine measures, while travellers with visas or permits valid for less than 14 days will be barred from entering Hong Kong. Cheung stressed the quarantine policy would not affect the flow of goods from the mainland. He said: I urge these people, especially those quarantined at home, to have a social conscience and civic responsibility, be cooperative and self-disciplined. Any rule breakers will be breaking the law. One person in Hong Kong has died from coronavirus.",

        "news": "The test used to diagnose coronavirus is being rolled out to laboratories across the UK from Monday, increasing testing capacity to more than 1,000 people a day. Currently coronavirus is tested and diagnosed in one laboratory in London, but testing will be extended to 12 labs across the country over the coming weeks. At its laboratories in London, Public Health England (PHE) has the capacity to process samples from more than 100 people a day. Now, to ensure that the country is prepared for further cases and to speed up the time taken to get results, the test will be carried out by trained scientists across England, Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland. This will increase testing capacity to more than 1,000 people a day for England. Prof Yvonne Doyle, PHE’s medical director, said: Once China confirmed that they had identified a novel coronavirus, Public Health England was ready to test potential cases in this country. We have now trained scientists in labs across the UK to conduct the specialist test – ensuring that we are well prepared should we begin to see an increased number of cases across the country. The test, developed by PHE, made the UK one of the first countries outside China to have assured testing capability for the new coronavirus. When a clinician suspects coronavirus in a patient, they take samples from the nose, throat and deeper respiratory tract and send them for laboratory testing. Using the diagnostic test, scientists can look for evidence of the presence of any type of coronavirus and then hone in on specific genetic clues that identify the novel coronavirus associated with this outbreak. The UK-wide roll-out is the fastest deployment of a new test to PHE and NHS labs in recent history, including in the swine flu pandemic in 2009. In addition to processing samples from suspected cases in the UK, PHE is now working as a reference laboratory for WHO, testing samples from countries that do not have assured testing capabilities.",

        "news": "The latest figures from China do not show a \"significant shift in the pattern of mortality or severity\" of the coronavirus, the World Health Organization’s Dr Michael Ryan has said. He explained that while China reported an extra 13,332 clinically confirmed cases in Hubei province today, these \"relate to a period going back days and weeks\" and have been retrospectively classified based on diagnosis by medical professionals while awaiting laboratory test confirmation. We’re not dealing with a spike of cases of 14,000 in one day. This does not represent a significant change in the trajectory of the virus. It remains unclear whether the spike in deaths reported by China - an additional 254 fatalities - relate to these clinically confirmed cases or not. Ryan, the executive director of the WHO health emergencies programme, said that apart from the Diamond Princess cruise ship, which now has 218 confirmed cases, there has been no dramatic transmission outside China. \"The iceberg may not be that great, but that’s not a guarantee,\" he added. The rest of a special WHO team is expected to arrive in China over the coming weekend to investigative the epicentre of the coronavirus outbreak, he announced. When asked about the most urgent action need to tackle the epidemic, Ryan raised a few issues. He said the clinical trials in China should be expanded to countries such as Japan and Singapore, in order to better understand which treatments are effective. \"Knowing which drugs work would be a wonderful gift,\" he said, adding that antivirals used during the Sars and Mers epidemics are being trialled.

He said that while vaccines and new drugs will take a lot longer to produce, there is no time to be wasted in investment and development. He added that it will take hundreds of millions of dollars of investment in multiple drug candidates to find a solution, and states are going to have to support the private sector in this endeavour. Finally, he said \"we need a vaccine against misinformation\" to better inform the public about the disease and communicate in a more effective way.",

        "news": "China has ordered three reporters from American newspaper the Wall Street Journal to leave the country, over what Beijing deemed a racist headline. The expulsion came as Beijing slammed Washington’s decision to tighten rules on Chinese state media organisations in the United States, calling the move \"unreasonable and unacceptable\", AFP reports. A Chinese foreign ministry spokesman Geng Shuang said the Journal op-ed - titled \"China is the Real Sick Man of Asia\" - had a \"racially discriminatory\" and \"sensational\" headline, and slammed the newspaper for not issuing an official apology. Geng told a press briefing: As such, China has decided that from today, the press cards of three Wall Street Journal reporters in Beijing will be revoked. The Journal reported that deputy bureau chief Josh Chin and reporter Chao Deng, both US nationals, as well as reporter Philip Wen, an Australian, had been ordered to leave the country in five days. The three journalists are in the Wall Street Journal’s news section, which is not linked to the editorial and opinion section. The op-ed, written by Bard College professor Walter Russell Mead, criticised the Chinese government’s initial response to the new coronavirus outbreak. It called the Wuhan city government \"secretive and self-serving\", while dismissing national efforts as ineffective. The phrase \"sick man of Asia\" originally referred to China in the late 19th and early 20th century, when it was exploited by foreign powers during a period sometimes called the country’s \"century of humiliation\". The 3 February piece \"slandered the efforts of the Chinese government and the Chinese people to fight the epidemic\", said Geng. The new coronavirus epidemic has killed over 2,000 people in China and infected more than 74,000, and has spread to at least two dozen countries. \"The editors of the Wall Street Journal have nailed themselves to the pillar of shame,\" wrote the nationalistic Global Times in an op-ed on Tuesday before the reporters were expelled. The WSJ’s remarks \"sound like gloating, and they disgust Chinese people\", it said. The expulsions come a day after the United States angered China for classifying five state media outlets, including Xinhua news agency and the China Global Television Network, as foreign missions, with State Department officials saying they were part of Beijing’s growing \"propaganda\" apparatus. Voicing China’s \"strong dissatisfaction\", Geng added cryptically: \"We reserve the right to respond further to this matter.\"",

The scientists cite conspiracy theories circulating on social media which claim that the coronavirus was artificially manufactured in a lab conducting bioweapons research. They are \"crackpot theories that need to be addressed, but in the age of social media it is just impossible\", Daszak said.",

That has given us a blueprint for building on that for the new arrival of guests. I was pleased for the staff and partners who had spent such lot of time making sure their stay was as comfortable as possible and clearly I think because we did such a good job we were asked to support this group of travellers that are coming back from a cruise in Japan. The group of people is slightly different. Obviously they have come from a cruise ship rather than from their own homes over in China but we are working exactly the same as we did before with the healthcare professionals and Public Health England to make sure they are safe, well managed and comfortable while they are with us.

Stocks are still struggling but he rings the alarm on an apparent freeze in lending: The most concerning thing is the fact that credit markets froze. In very unusual trading there were no new corporate bonds issued in Europe or the USA. This last occurred on a non-holiday in 2007, just before the global peak in equity markets and the plunge that heralded the GFC. In Australia, BIS Oxford Economics have said that weak capex figures for the fourth quarter released on Thursday morning makes it more likely that the Reserve Bank will have to reduce rates or introduce some kind of monetary easing. The data confirm our view that capex growth this year will be soft, and is very likely to miss the RBA’s forecast – as the survey was done in Q4 it does not include any additional drag from the coronavirus outbreak. We continue to expect further monetary easing, and the pressure will mount on the government to loosen policy in its May budget. Aust capex plans for 2020-21 are +8.8% on plans a yr ago for 2019-20 (first chart) due to a 28% uplift in mining inv plans. Non-mining plans remain weak (second chart).

        "news": "Oliver Milman, an environment reporter for Guardian in New York, has some analysis on the progression of the coronavirus pandemic in the US. A model relied upon by the White House, from the University of Washington, estimates that the virus will \"peter out\" in May and then essentially grind to a halt by the summer. This is based on the experiences of China and Italy, previous coronavirus hotspots. But this model, like all predictions, is dynamic and depends upon the application of measures such as social distancing to slow the rate of transmission. Other forecasts have been more pessimistic, warning that it will be difficult to tame the spread of the virus until well after summer. Premature relaxation of restrictions on gatherings of people could see a second, much more severe, increase in infections. The sheer size of the US, as well as its large population, means that there will be several ‘peaks’ at different times across the country. While the situation may be starting to stabilize somewhat in New York, areas in the heart of the country have yet to see the worst of the virus.\"That is going to be confusing for people,\" said Doug Burgum, governor of North Dakota. \"If wow, New York had all these deaths and they are opening up, why aren’t we opening? That will be a communication challenge for us, but we have to just keep monitoring and see where we are going on this.\"",

On Sunday, Pompeo said: \"There is enormous evidence that that’s where this began,\" later adding: \"I can tell you that there is a significant amount of evidence that this came from that laboratory in Wuhan.\" At one point, the secretary of state appeared confused over whether he was claiming the Sars-CoV-2 virus (which causes the Covid-19 disease) was deliberately engineered or escaped as the result of a lab accident. \"Look, the best experts so far seem to think it was manmade. I have no reason to disbelieve that at this point,\" he said. But when he was reminded that US intelligence had issued a formal statement noting the opposite – that the scientific consensus was that the virus was not manmade or genetically modified – Pompeo replied: \"That’s right.

Scientists believe the killer virus jumped from animals to humans, emerging in China late last year, possibly from a market in Wuhan selling exotic animals for meat. But US President Donald Trump, increasingly critical of China’s management of the first outbreak, claims to have proof it started in a Wuhan laboratory. And US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo on Sunday said \"enormous evidence\" backed up that claim, which China has vehemently denied. \"Like any evidence-based organisation, we would be very willing to receive any information that purports to the origin of the virus,\" Ryan said, stressing that this was \"a very important piece of public health information for future control. \"If that data and evidence is available, then it will be for the United States government to decide whether and when it can be shared, but it is difficult for the WHO to operate in an information vacuum in that regard,\" he added.",

The US president Donald Trump had to give one year’s notice of for withdrawal from the Geneva-based UN agency under a 1948 joint resolution of the US Congress, which also obliges Washington to pay financial support. The United States currently owes the WHO more than $200m (approximately £160m) in assessed contributions, according to the WHO website. After more than 70 years of membership, the United States moved to quit the WHO after Trump accused it of becoming a puppet of China amid the pandemic. The virus first emerged in China’s Wuhan city late last year. Stéphane Dujarric, a UN spokesman, said: The secretary general ... is in the process of verifying with the World Health Organization whether all the conditions for such withdrawal are met. Trump had halted US funding for the 194-member organisation in April, then demanded a series of reforms on 18 May, before announcing the decision to pull the US out less than two weeks later. The WHO is an independent international body that works with the United Nations. The UN sSecretary general António Guterres has said the WHO is \"absolutely critical to the world’s efforts to win the war against Covid-19\". Trump has long scorned multilateralism as he focuses on an \"America First\" agenda. Since taking office, he has quit the UN Human Rights Council, the UN cultural agency, a global accord to tackle climate change and the Iran nuclear deal. He has also cut funding for the UN population fund and the UN agency that aids Palestinian refugees.",

Apart from warning of discrimination recently, China’s culture and tourism ministry advised against travelling to Australia last month due to increasing racism linked to the virus. On Monday, the foreign ministry said that \"racial discrimination and acts of violence in Australia have significantly increased\", accusing Australian media of fanning the flames of anti-Chinese sentiment. The Chinese foreign ministry’s latest notice also came days after Australia offered about 10,000 people from Hong Kong pathways to permanent residency in response to China’s crackdown on dissent in the city, encouraging entrepreneurs or skilled workers to relocate as well. The moves drew ire from Beijing. \"Australia’s relevant law enforcement authorities arbitrarily search Chinese citizens and seize their items, and these circumstances could cause harm to Chinese citizens in Australia, as well as the safety of their assets,\" said the ministry. The notice posted on the WeChat social media app also reminded Chinese citizens to \"pay close attention\" to local safety risks and \"travel with caution to Australia in the near-term\".

        "news": "Here’s a summary of recent events: •France identified Lyon and Nice as virus \"red zones\", where additional measures would be needed to control the spread of Covid-19. Later Reuters reported the French government would not be joining WHO’s international vaccine programme, a blow to the UN body’s effort to discourage \"vaccine nationalism\". •Canada could lose its ability to manage the coronavirus pandemic owing to a worrying recent surge in Covid-19 cases, the country’s top medical officer has said. The warning from the chief public health officer, Theresa Tam, is the clearest indication yet of how worried authorities in the country are about the potential for the outbreak to spiral out of control. •Facebook said it would no longer show health groups in its recommendations to ensure users get health information from authoritative sources. It said the move reflected its view that such sources of information were \"crucial\". •In the US, New York City once again delayed the return of most of the million-plus students in its public schools. The mayor, Bill de Blasio, said most elementary school students would do remote-only learning until 29 September. •Wuhan, ground zero for the coronavirus outbreak, has reopened for international flights, ending an eight-month moratorium since the disease first emerged. China stopped international flights in March as global alarm increased about the spread of Covid-19, but has now largely brought the disease under control. •The World Health Organization warned of \"alarming rates of transmission\" of Covid-19 across Europe and cautioned countries against shortening quarantine periods. The body said the number of coronavirus cases in September \"should serve as a wake-up call for all of us\". That’s all from me. Lucy Campbell will pick up the baton shortly.",

        "news": "The Australian prime minister, Scott Morrison, is standing firm on his calls for the independent investigation into the origins of the coronavirus and urged all nations to share a vaccine once it is proven. Morrison’s pre-recorded speech on the virtual stage on Saturday morning to the 75th United Nations general assembly, praised the World Health Organization for establishing an inquiry into the global response to coronavirus, AAP reports. \"There is also a clear mandate to identify the zoonotic source of the Covid-19 virus and how it was transmitted to humans,\" he said. \"This virus has inflicted a calamity on our world and its peoples. We must do all we can to understand what happened for no other purpose than to prevent it from happening again.\" The inquiry resolution backed by 145 countries in May does not mention China, instead committing to an impartial, independent and comprehensive evaluation. China eventually supported the European Union motion. Ties between the two nations have since been fraught, with tariffs being imposed on some goods and Australian journalists being evacuated from China. Morrison urged other leaders to share a coronavirus vaccine if they discover one. He has previously said if Australia found a vaccine, it would be shared across the world. \"This is a global responsibility and it’s a moral responsibility for a vaccine to be shared far and wide,\" he said. \"Some might see short-term advantage or even profit. But I assure you to anyone who may think along those lines, humanity will have a very long memory and be a very, very severe judge.\"",

        "news": "Peru has secured enough coronavirus vaccine to give nearly three-quarters of its population at least one dose when the immunization is available, a hopeful development for a nation with one of the highest COVID-19 death rates in the world, reports Reuters. The agreements announced on Friday with Pfizer Inc and global vaccine distribution program COVAX will provide 23.1 million doses for a population of 31.9 million. Some vaccine regimes will require two doses. The Peruvian Ministry of Health said it had signed a binding agreement with Pfizer for the purchase of 9.9 million doses of its vaccine which is in testing. Another 13.2 million doses will be bought through COVAX, which is led by the GAVI vaccines alliance and the World Health Organization and aimed at promoting equitable access. COVAX has signed agreements to buy vaccines from French drugmaker Sanofi, Britain’s GlaxoSmithKline, AstraZeneca and Novavax. Health Minister Pilar Mazzetti said this week that she expects vaccines to arrive in Peru in the first quarter of 2021 before general elections on April 11, and vaccines will likely be administered in voting centers. China’s Sinopharm and the United States’ Johnson &amp; Johnson are conducting trials of their vaccines in the country, potentially allowing Peru to buy doses at a discount, the ministry of health said. Peru has seen 111.55 deaths per 100,000 of its population, ranking third in the world for per capita mortality, according to a Reuters tally.",

Andrew Parker who was the director general of MI5 until two and half weeks ago, told a webinar: I’m just not aware of any evidence that it is anything other than what people think it is: It came via markets. There are all sorts of hypotheses around, but I just think it is not useful to speculate, worry about all that. The former British spy chief said it was the business of intelligence agencies to find out if there was ever a point when a state or non-state actor was trying to deliberately spread a dangerous disease. In that case, he said, there \"should be an expectation that the agencies will somehow uncover that\". But, in remarks that could have been addressed directly to the US president Donald Trump or the secretary of state Mike Pompeo, Parker concluded: Conspiracy theories right now are not helpful. Both Trump and Pompeo have publicly pushed the lab leak theory without offering supporting evidence. British intelligence agencies have been saying for the past couple of weeks they don’t subscribe to the lab leak theory, although the idea is nevertheless being pushed in news media in the UK, US and Australia.

Death rates are climbing in parts of Mexico, and similar trends are seen in Ecuador, Costa Rica and Bolivia, with similar patterns also emerging in areas of Argentina, she warned. Although the entire world is racing to develop new tools to prevent and cure Covid-19, a safe and effective vaccine that can be manufactured and delivered at scale is not around the corner. We must be clear that opening up too early gives this virus more room to spread and puts our populations at greater risk. Look no further than Europe. Etienne said governments must monitor travel very carefully because reopening to tourism can lead to setbacks. That has happened in the Caribbean, where several countries that had virtually no cases have experienced spikes as tourism resumed.

The UK’s toll overtook that of Italy on 6 May, with close to 30,000 fatalities, and for a while over the summer the southern European nation appeared to have weathered the storm. But despite the introduction of mass testing, cases began rising again in early autumn, as they did in many other nations - and deaths inevitably followed. Italy’s national medical association said Friday that a total of 251 doctors have now died from the virus. \"In this second wave, it is mainly general practitioners who are paying the highest toll,\" warned Filippo Anelli, head of the FNOMCeO association.

        "news": "China has ordered three reporters from American newspaper the Wall Street Journal to leave the country, over what Beijing deemed a racist headline. The expulsion came as Beijing slammed Washington’s decision to tighten rules on Chinese state media organisations in the United States, calling the move \"unreasonable and unacceptable\", AFP reports. A Chinese foreign ministry spokesman Geng Shuang said the Journal op-ed - titled \"China is the Real Sick Man of Asia\" - had a \"racially discriminatory\" and \"sensational\" headline, and slammed the newspaper for not issuing an official apology. Geng told a press briefing: As such, China has decided that from today, the press cards of three Wall Street Journal reporters in Beijing will be revoked. The Journal reported that deputy bureau chief Josh Chin and reporter Chao Deng, both US nationals, as well as reporter Philip Wen, an Australian, had been ordered to leave the country in five days. The three journalists are in the Wall Street Journal’s news section, which is not linked to the editorial and opinion section. The op-ed, written by Bard College professor Walter Russell Mead, criticised the Chinese government’s initial response to the new coronavirus outbreak. It called the Wuhan city government \"secretive and self-serving\", while dismissing national efforts as ineffective. The phrase \"sick man of Asia\" originally referred to China in the late 19th and early 20th century, when it was exploited by foreign powers during a period sometimes called the country’s \"century of humiliation\". The 3 February piece \"slandered the efforts of the Chinese government and the Chinese people to fight the epidemic\", said Geng. The new coronavirus epidemic has killed over 2,000 people in China and infected more than 74,000, and has spread to at least two dozen countries. \"The editors of the Wall Street Journal have nailed themselves to the pillar of shame,\" wrote the nationalistic Global Times in an op-ed on Tuesday before the reporters were expelled. The WSJ’s remarks \"sound like gloating, and they disgust Chinese people\", it said. The expulsions come a day after the United States angered China for classifying five state media outlets, including Xinhua news agency and the China Global Television Network, as foreign missions, with State Department officials saying they were part of Beijing’s growing \"propaganda\" apparatus. Voicing China’s \"strong dissatisfaction\", Geng added cryptically: \"We reserve the right to respond further to this matter.\"",

Outside of Iran, which has reported just over 50,000 cases, confirmed coronavirus numbers have been relatively low in the Middle East compared to Europe, the United States and Asia. But health officials fear that cases of the highly contagious respiratory illness caused by the virus are under-reported and that many countries with weak governments and health systems eroded by conflict will struggle to cope. \"I cannot stress enough the urgency of the situation,\" said Mandhari. \"The increasing numbers of cases show that transmission is rapidly occurring at local and community levels.\" \"We still have a window of opportunity, but this window is slowly closing day by day,\" he added.",

        "news": "Global coronavirus cases rose by more than 400,000 for the first time late on Friday, a record one-day increase as much of Europe enacts new restrictions to curb the outbreak. Europe, which successfully damped down the first surge of infections, has emerged as the new coronavirus epicentre in recent weeks and is reporting on average 140,000 cases a day over the past week. As a region, Europe is reporting more daily cases than India, Brazil and the US combined. Of every 100 infections reported around the world, 34 were from European countries, according to a Reuters analysis. The region is currently reporting a million new infections about every nine days and has reported more than 6.3 million cases since the pandemic began. Major European countries - the UK, France, Russia, the Netherlands and Spain - accounted for about half of Europe’s new cases in the week to 18 October. France is reporting the highest seven-day average of new cases in Europe with 19,425 infections per day followed by the United Kingdom, Russia, Spain and the Netherlands in the list of worst affected European countries. Several European countries are closing schools, cancelling elective surgeries and enlisting student medics as the authorities face a Covid-19 resurgence. Russia is moving students to online learning and Northern Ireland is closing schools for two weeks and restaurants for four. In Spain, authorities in Catalonia ordered bars and restaurants to close for 15 days and limited the numbers of people allowed in shops. The Czech Republic has also shifted schools to distance learning and plans to call up thousands of medical students. Hospitals are cutting non-urgent medical procedures to free up beds. Polish health officials have warned the country is on the brink of a disaster as a record 6,526 new coronavirus infections and 116 deaths were reported this week. Poland is ramping up training for nurses and considering creating military field hospitals. Latin America is the worst-affected region with about 27% of total Covid-19 cases followed by Asia, North America and Europe. India is reporting fewer cases this month compared with September, with 69,000 cases per day. The numbers have fallen by more than 20,400 over the last three weeks, down 22% from its previous peak. India reported 55,342 cases on 13 October, its lowest daily increase since 18 August. In the US, which has the largest total number of cases and deaths in the world, new infections are edging higher along with the most hospitalised Covid-19 patients since early September.",

        "title": "Africa passes one million confirmed virus cases",
        "news": "Africa’s confirmed coronavirus cases have surpassed one million, but global health experts say the true toll is likely several times higher, reflecting the gaping lack of testing for the continent’s 1.3 billion people. While experts say infection tolls in richer nations can be significant undercounts, large numbers of undetected cases are a greater danger for Africa, with many of the world’s weakest health systems. The World Health Organization calls the milestone a pivotal point for Africa as infections in several countries are surging. The virus has spread beyond major cities into distant hinterlands where few health resources exist and reaching care could take days. African nations banded together early in the pandemic to pursue badly needed testing and medical supplies and advocate for equitable access to any successful vaccine. Swift border closures delayed the virus spread. But Africa’s most developed country, South Africa, has strained to cope as hospital beds fill up and confirmed cases are over a half-million, ranking fifth in the world. The country has Africa’s most extensive testing and data collection, and yet a South African Medical Research Council report last week showed many Covid-19 deaths were going uncounted. Other deaths were attributed to other diseases as people avoid health centres and resources are diverted to the pandemic. The WHO’s Africa chief, Matshidiso Moeti, said: It’s all a warning for Africa’s other 53 countries of what might lie ahead. While dire early predictions for the pandemic have not played out, we think its going to be here at a slow burn. Just two African countries at the start of the pandemic were equipped to test for the virus. Now virtually all have basic capacity, but supplies are often scarce. Some countries have a single testing machine. Some conduct fewer than 500 tests per million people, while richer countries overseas conduct hundreds of thousands. Samples can take days to reach labs. Even in South Africa, turnaround times for many test results have been a week or longer. \"We are fighting this disease in the dark,\" International Rescue Committee expert Stacey Mearns said. In addition, Africa has just 1,500 epidemiologists, a deficit of about 4,500. African nations overall have conducted just 8.8 million tests since the pandemic began, well below the Africa Centers for Disease Control and Preventions goal of 13 million per month. Africa CDC director John Nkengasong said estimating the true number of cases on the continent is very tricky. Some 70% of infections are asymptomatic, he said. But some experts are making their best guesses. Africa likely has at least 5 million infections, said Ridhwaan Suliman, a senior researcher at South Africa’s Council for Scientific and Industrial Research. He believes the true number in South Africa alone is at least 3 million. The country has conducted far more tests than any other in Africa, more than 3 million, but in recent days about 25% have come back positive. Because of shortages, South Africa largely limits testing to health workers and those showing symptoms.Experts see South Africa as an indication of whats to come elsewhere. Sema Sgaier, an assistant professor of global health at Harvard and director of the Surgo Foundation, thinks the number of infections across Africa could be more than 9 million. The US-based Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation puts the number at more than 8 million. And Resolve to Save Lives, led by Tom Frieden, former director of the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, estimates it could be 14 million.",

Reuters reports that half a million deaths occurred in just the last two months, indicating that the severity of the pandemic is far from over. Nearly 65 million people globally have been infected by the disease and the worst affected country, United States, is currently battling a third wave of coronavirus infections. In the last week alone, more than 10,000 people in the world died on average every single day, which has been steadily rising each passing week. Many countries across the world are now fighting second and third waves even greater than the first, forcing new restrictions on everyday life. The coronavirus caused more deaths in the past year than tuberculosis in 2019 and nearly four times the number of deaths due to malaria, according to the World Health Organisation. Robert Redfield, the head of the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, warned on Wednesday that the pandemic will pose the country’s grimmest health crisis yet over the next few months, before vaccines become widely available. Redfield told a livestream presentation hosted by the US Chamber of Commerce Foundation: I actually believe they’re going to be the most difficult time in the public health history of this nation. The United States continues to lead in terms of fatalities, with over 273,000 deaths alone. North America and Latin American regions combined have more than 50% of all coronavirus deaths that have been reported.

        "news": "Several large US states including Texas are not heeding new federal health officials’ calls to reduce Covid-19 testing of some exposed to the virus, joining a broad rebuke of the Trump administration by public health leaders. Arizona, California, Connecticut, Florida, Illinois, Texas, New Jersey and New York all plan to continue to test asymptomatic people who have been exposed to Covid-19, despite new guidance from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) suggesting that such tests may not be needed. \"The current Texas guidance recommends testing for all close contacts of a confirmed case because it allows for early case identification among people who are at a higher risk of infection,\" a spokesman for the Texas Department of State Health Services in a statement. \"There’s not a planned change at this point.\" California and New York made similar statements. The Florida Department of Health said asymptomatic testing was continuing while the new CDC recommendations were evaluated, and Texas also said it would evaluate. The CDC said this week that people exposed to Covid-19 but not symptomatic may not need to be tested, shocking doctors and politicians, and prompting accusations the guidance was politically motivated. Even before the CDC guidance, coronavirus testing in the US had dropped. The US tested on average 675,000 people a day last week, down from a peak in late July of over 800,000 people a day. Nationally, cases have fallen for five weeks in a row but infections are surging again in the US Midwest with four states reporting record one-day increases in cases on Thursday as the US death toll climbed above 180,000. The CDC had previously recommended testing of all people who had close contact with someone who was diagnosed with Covid-19. New York governor Andrew Cuomo said the state of New York would not be abiding by the new guidance and challenged the assertion that politics played no role in the change. \"This 180-degree reversal of Covid-19 testing guidelines is reckless, and not based on science and has the potential to do long-term damage to the (CDC’s) reputation,\" Cuomo said in a joint statement, along with the governors of New Jersey and Connecticut, who also said their states would not be following the CDC’s guidance. Admiral Brett Giroir, the assistant secretary for health at the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), said there was no political pressure from the administration. He said that testing asymptomatic patients too early could produce false negatives and contribute to the virus’s spread. CNN and The New York Times reported on Wednesday that US public health officials were ordered by high-level members of the Trump administration to push forward with the changes. CDC director Robert Redfield issued a statement on Thursday that \"everyone who needs a Covid-19 test, can get a test,\" but \"everyone who wants a test does not necessarily need a test.\" Globally, many nations advocate early testing. The World Health Organization on Thursday said, that resources permitting, people exposed to the coronavirus should be tested even if they do not show immediate symptoms of infection. European governments have used broad testing and isolation to control the virus. France, for instance, recommends that anyone who thinks they need a test should get one and in Germany, people with close contact of 15 minutes or more with a person with Covid-19 are advised to have a test.",

        "news": "Oliver Milman, an environment reporter for Guardian in New York, has some analysis on the progression of the coronavirus pandemic in the US. A model relied upon by the White House, from the University of Washington, estimates that the virus will \"peter out\" in May and then essentially grind to a halt by the summer. This is based on the experiences of China and Italy, previous coronavirus hotspots. But this model, like all predictions, is dynamic and depends upon the application of measures such as social distancing to slow the rate of transmission. Other forecasts have been more pessimistic, warning that it will be difficult to tame the spread of the virus until well after summer. Premature relaxation of restrictions on gatherings of people could see a second, much more severe, increase in infections. The sheer size of the US, as well as its large population, means that there will be several ‘peaks’ at different times across the country. While the situation may be starting to stabilize somewhat in New York, areas in the heart of the country have yet to see the worst of the virus.\"That is going to be confusing for people,\" said Doug Burgum, governor of North Dakota. \"If wow, New York had all these deaths and they are opening up, why aren’t we opening? That will be a communication challenge for us, but we have to just keep monitoring and see where we are going on this.\"",

The Istituto Nazionale della Previdenza Sociale (INPS), the largest social security and welfare institute in Italy, said in a new study that the official death figures were not \"reliable\", according to AFP. Its study showed that 156,42 total deaths were recorded in Italy in March and April, which is 46,909 higher than the average number of fatalities in those months recorded between 2015 and 2019. But only 27,938 deaths linked to coronavirus were reported during that period by the Civil Protection Agency, whose toll forms the basis of national statistics, the INPS said. That meant there were 18,971 excess deaths during this period, with the vast majority of 18,412 recorded in the coronavirus-ravaged north of the country. \"Given the fact that the number of deaths is quite stable in these times, we can - with necessary caution - attribute a large portion of these deaths during these past two months to the epidemic,\" the INPS said. It added that the increase in deaths was likely not only due to the disease, but from people suffering from other illnesses unable to get healthcare due to hospitals being overwhelmed by the coronavirus pandemic. As of Friday, the pandemic has claimed 32,486 deaths in Italy, of which 26,715 have been in Lombardy alone, Europe’s worst affected region.",

        "news": "Cancer patients with Covid-19 treated with a drug combination promoted by US President Donald Trump to counter coronavirus were three times more likely to die within 30 days than those who got either drug alone, U.S. researchers said. The preliminary results suggest doctors may want to refrain from prescribing the decades-old malaria treatment hydroxychloroquine with the antibiotic azithromycin for these patients until more study is done, researchers said. \"Treatment with hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin were strongly associated with increased risk of death,\" Dr. Howard Burris, president of the American Society of Clinical Oncology(ASCO), said in a briefing with reporters on the results. The drug combination initially was thought to help Covid-19 patients, but recent data has cast doubt. The preliminary findings, to be presented this week at ASCO’s virtual scientific meeting, show that the combination may pose a significant risk to cancer patients. \"Taking the combination gives a three times increased risk of dying within 30 days of any cause,\" Dr. Jeremy Warner of Vanderbilt University Medical System told reporters. Trump, who has often promoted hydroxychloroquine, in a March 21 tweet called the combination potentially \"one of the biggest game changers in the history of medicine.\" That was based on a study of fewer than 40 patients in the International Journal of Antimicrobial Agents. More recent studies have shown little or no benefit and increased risks. Warner and colleagues analysed data on 925 patients with cancer who became infected with the coronavirus between March and April. Thirteen percent of the patients died within 30 days of their diagnosis. Overall, patients whose cancers were actively progressing at the time of infection were five times more likely to die within 30 days than those who were in remission or had no current evidence of cancer. In the trial, 180 patients were taking hydroxychloroquine in combination with azithromycin, and 90 were taking hydroxychloroquine alone. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has allowed healthcare providers to prescribe the drugs for Covid-19 through an emergency-use authorisation, but has not approved the treatment. The governments of France, Italy and Belgium moved on Wednesday to halt the use of hydroxychloroquine for Covid-19 patients following a World Health Organization decision on Monday to pause a large trial of the drug due to safety concerns.",

        "news": "A record 1,262 Covid-19 deaths have been recorded in Brazil today - taking the country’s total death toll to 31,199 - but the president continues to downplay the pandemic.The figures were announced on Tuesday evening by Brazil’s health ministry, which also said the number of coronavirus cases had risen to 555,383, second only to the United States.The South American country is now on the verge of overtaking Italy, where 33,530 deaths have been recorded, as the country with the third highest number of deaths.But Brazil’s far-right president, Jair Bolsonaro, who has dismissed Covid-19 as a \"little flu\", again brushed off the tragedy on Tuesday.\"I regret each of the deaths - but that’s everyone’s destiny,\" Bolsonaro told supporters outside his palace in the capitalBrasília.Brazil’s most populous state, São Paulo, registered a record number of deaths on Tuesday taking the total number of fatalities there to nearly 8,000. Rio de Janeiro has Brazil’s second highest death toll with 5,686 deaths, followed by the northeastern state of Ceará where 3,421 people have died.For all Bolsonaro’s dismissiveness, scientists and medical experts believe the situation is dire and likely to get worse. \"Not even in our most dreadful nightmare could we have imagined the situation we are now in,\" Drauzio Varella, a doctor and broadcaster, wrote in one of Brazil’s top newspapers last week.",

        "title": "Brazilian senator calls for inquiry into Covid-19 data",
        "news": "Brazil has drawn further criticism for its handling of the coronavirus pandemic after sharing contradictory figures on deaths and infections, intensifying a scandal over the country’s Covid-19 data. A senator called for a congressional inquiry and the discrepancy prompted criticism from across the political spectrum after initial health ministry data on Brazil’s number of cases and death toll was contradicted by numbers uploaded to the ministry’s online data portal. On Monday, the ministry said in a statement the discrepancy was predominantly due to mistakes in the numbers from two states that were later corrected. It explained that the later, lower daily death toll of 525 was the correct one. Senator Eliziane Gama, leader of centrist party Citizenship, asked the Senate to open an inquiry into the numbers, while the WHO stressed the importance of \"consistent and transparent\" communication from Brazil. It ranks second in confirmed cases, behind the United States, and its death toll last week surpassed Italy’s. The discrepancy followed recent decisions to remove from a national website a trove of data about the country’s outbreak, and to push back the daily release of new numbers late into the evening and after the country’s main television news program. Brazil could see Covid-19 deaths rise to 165,960 by August, above the forecast for the United States which has 100 million more people, according to a new projection by the University of Washington’s Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation.The updated forecast suggests Brazil’s epidemic could become the most lethal globally. For Carlos Machado, head of research at the National School of Public Health, part of the respected public institute Oswaldo Cruz Foundation, the lack of dependable data in Brazil is dangerous. \"Not having updated and reliable data during a pandemic of this proportion is like driving in the dark,\" he said. \"While we do not have a vaccine, information is the best weapon we have.\" \"By changing the numbers, the ministry of health covers the sun with a sieve,\" Rodrigo Maia, speaker of the lower house, said on Twitter. \"The credibility of the statistics needs to be urgently recovered. A ministry that manipulates numbers creates a parallel world in order not to face the reality of the facts.\" According to the council, Brazil had recorded 680,456 cases of Covid-19 and 36,151 deaths from the disease by the end of Sunday afternoon.",

        "title": "FDA revokes emergency use of malaria drug Trump touted as coronavirus treatment",
        "news": "The US Food and Drug Administration has revoked its emergency use authorisation for hydroxychloroquine to treat Covid-19, the drug championed by president Donald Trump. Based on new evidence, the FDA said it was no longer reasonable to believe that oral formulations of hydroxychloroquine and the related drug chloroquine may be effective in treating the illness caused by the coronavirus. The move comes after several studies of the decades-old malaria drug suggested it was not effective, including a widely anticipated trial earlier this month that showed it failed to prevent infection in people who had been exposed to the virus. The drug’s anti-inflammatory and antiviral properties suggested it might help treat Covid-19, and the FDA authorised its emergency use in March. While it did appear to neutralise the virus in laboratory experiments, hydroxychloroquine, which is also used to treat lupus and rheumatoid arthritis, has failed to prove its worth in human Covid-19 trials, thus far. In March, Trump said hydroxychloroquine used in combination with the antibiotic azithromycin had \"a real chance to be one of the biggest game changers in the history of medicine,\" with little evidence to back up that claim. He later said he took the drugs preventively after two people who worked at the White House were diagnosed with Covid-19, and he urged others to try it. Doctors in recent weeks had already pulled back on the use of hydroxychloroquine as a Covid-19 treatment, after several studies suggested it is not effective and may pose heart risks for certain patients. France, Italy and Belgium late last month moved to halt the use of hydroxychloroquine to treat Covid-19 patients. But the United States last month supplied Brazil with 2m doses for use against Covid-19, as the South American country has emerged as the pandemic’s latest epicenter. Meanwhile, some 400 trials are listed as using hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine as interventions for Covid-19, more than half of them still ongoing, according to a recent analysis from research firm GlobalData. In the United States, the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases last month launched a trial designed to show whether hydroxychloroquine in combination with azithromycin can prevent hospitalisation and death from Covid-19.",

The class action, which includes complaints from the families of three passengers who died of Covid-19, accuses the Italy-based cruise giant of negligence and various faults during their trip on the Costa Magica. From 6 to 13 March the ship was refused to dock in most of the Caribbean islands it visited, including Trinidad and Tobago, Grenada, Barbados and Saint Lucia. In the absence of stopovers, the crew encouraged the passengers to use the ship’s shops, spas, restaurants and casino without sufficiently putting health measures in place, or informing them there were suspected infections onboard, the complainants said in their suit. The staff members on the ship \"were at fault, the passengers had almost no information and only found out from local media that there were cases on the ship,\" lawyer Philippe Courtois, who represents the collective of some 850 French passengers, told AFP. Courtois also criticised the \"extremely light\" virus measures on the ship. \"It was meant to be a dream cruise, but it ended in an ordeal,\" he said. Costa Cruises, which is part of the Carnival group, has suspended its trips worldwide until 15 August due to the pandemic.",

        "news": "Widespread reopening of schools after lockdowns and vacations is generally not linked to rising Covid-19 rates, a study of 191 countries has found, but lockdown closures will leave a 2020 \"pandemic learning debt\" of 300bn missed school days. The analysis, by the Geneva-based independent educational foundation Insights for Education, said 84% of those 300bn days would be lost by children in poorer countries, and warned that 711 million pupils were still out of school. \"It’s been assumed that opening schools will drive infections, and that closing schools will reduce transmission, but the reality is much more complex,\" said IfE’s founder and chief executive Randa Grob-Zakhary. The vast majority – 92% – of countries that are through their first wave of Covid-19 infections have started to reopen school systems, even as some are seeing a second surge. IfE found that 52 countries – including France and Spain – that sent students back to school in August and September saw infection rates rise during the vacation compared to when they were closed. In Britain and Hungary, however, infection levels dropped after initial school closures, remained low during the holidays, and began rising after reopening. Full analysis of these 52 countries found no firm correlation between school status and infections – pointing to a need to consider other factors, IfE said. \"The key now is to learn from those countries that are reopening effectively against a backdrop of rising infections,\" Grob-Zakhary said. The report said 44 countries have kept schools closed. It found countries are developing strategies for schools during the pandemic, such as in Italy and France, which order temporary school closures on a case-by-case basis. Other measures include policies on masks, class rotations and combining remote with in-school lessons. Grob-Zakhary said: This first real global test highlights what school life looks like in a Covid-world. Understanding how countries undergoing a massive second wave are dealing with this new reality in the classroom is essential to guide future reopening decisions and to help schools remain open.",

The decree was approved at a cabinet meeting after a steady increase in cases over the last two months. It will probably be effective from Thursday, a government source said. Several Italian regions including Lazio, around the capital Rome, had already made face masks mandatory. Data from the health ministry showed 3,678 cases were reported in the last 24 hours, up from 2,677 on Tuesday and surging past the 3,000 mark for the first time since 24 April. Italy is still recording far fewer daily cases than other large European countries such as France, Spain and the UK. As a part of Rome’s effort to curb the spread of the virus, the health minister Roberto Speranza on Wednesday ordered compulsory testing on travellers from the United Kingdom, Belgium, the Netherlands and Czech Republic [see 8.35pm]. Italy was the first country in Europe to be hard-hit by Covid-19 and has the second highest death toll in the continent after the UK, with 36,061 deaths recorded since the outbreak began in February, according to official figures. Thanks to one of the strictest lockdowns in the world, the government managed to get the virus under control by the summer but infections are now rising fast. However, daily Covid-related deaths remain far lower than during the first wave of Italy’s epidemic six months ago. Some 31 people died on Wednesday, the health ministry said, while 24 April, the last day with more than 3,000 cases, saw 420 deaths. The cabinet on Wednesday also approved a decree to extend the Covid-19 state of emergency to 31 January. The state of emergency, originally due to expire in mid-October, gives greater powers to central government, making it easier for officials to bypass the bureaucracy that smothers much decision-making in Italy.",

        "title": "Four Italian regions to go into partial lockdown",
        "news": "Four Italian regions will go into partial lockdown from Friday as the government scrambles to regain control of the coronavirus pandemic. Giuseppe Conte’s government is trying to avoid a full national shutdown and has instead introduced a three-tier system that divides the country’s 20 regions up according to level of risk. The northern regions of Lombardy, Piedmont and Aosta Valley, along with Calabria in the south, have been placed in the \"red zone\", meaning people will only be able to leave their homes for work, health or emergency reasons and bars, restaurants and non-essential shops – apart from hairdressers – will close. People will be banned from travelling in or out of their regions. In Puglia and Sicilia, which have been placed in the orange zone, bars and restaurants will be closed and people will be able to move freely within their towns and cities but not leave them. The rest of the country will be in the yellow zone, meaning there will be no new restrictions apart from those already imposed nationally, such as the 6pm closure of bars and restaurants and complete closure of cinemas, theatres and gyms. All regions will be under a 10pm-5am curfew. Unlike in the spring, factories will stay open across the country. Restrictions per region have been determined by the rate of Covid-19 transmission, the number of infections and people with symptoms and the availability of hospital beds. The measures will be in place until 3 December. \"The virus here, and in the whole of Europe, is racing strongly, and violently,\" Conte said. Cases last week doubled compared to the previous one, the rate of transmission has increased to 1.7 nationally, and in some regions it’s higher. There are no alternatives, to slow the curve we need these restrictions … I understand the inconvenience and frustration, but we have to hold tight. Conte said intensive care capacity would be at risk in 15 of Italy’s 20 regions within a few weeks unless new measures were enacted. Italy registered 30,550 new coronavirus cases on Wednesday and 352 fatalities. The number of people hospitalised across the country stood at 22,116 Wednesday, of whom 2,292 were in intensive care – more than double the number on 24 October. Doctors had called for more aggressive restrictions as hospitals become overwhelmed and staff fall sick – 14,000 health workers were infected with coronavirus between September and October, and 184 medics have died since the start of the pandemic. The worst-affected regions in terms of daily caseload are Lombardy, which on Wednesday registered 7,758 cases, Campania, which for now is in the yellow zone, and Piedmont.",

        "news": "Italy will ramp up coronavirus restrictions in Tuscany and four other regions from Wednesday to rein in the second wave of the pandemic, a health ministry source said on Monday. Last week, the government imposed nationwide curbs including a nightly curfew, and divided the country into three zones based on the intensity of their Covid-19 outbreaks, calibrating additional limitations accordingly. Tuscany, which includes the cities of Florence and Siena; Liguria; Abruzzo; Umbria and the southern Basilicata region are designated as \"orange zones\" where bars and restaurants are closed but shops remain open. People are free to move within their towns and cities but not leave them. The zoning depends on factors such as local infection rates and hospital occupancy. Milan and most of the industrial north are part of the \"red zone\" under a partial lockdown. The northern province of Bolzano will be added into the red zone, the source added. The southern regions of Puglia and Sicily were already part of the orange zone. Italy, the first European country hard-hit by Covid-19, tamed its outbreak after a rigid lockdown in March and April, but has toughened up its curbs once again following a resurgence in infections and deaths. On Monday, the country registered 25,271 new infections after 32,616 the day before, mainly due to a customary fall in daily tests on Sundays. Covid-related deaths were 356, the health ministry said. The steady surge in hospital admissions is straining the country’s health system, and doctors warn that Italy could suffer some 10,000 fatalities in the next month on current trends. \"The situation could become tragic ... We need drastic measures, such as a total lockdown,\" said Filippo Anelli, the president of Italy’s doctors’ federation.",

        "news": "Italy on Saturday became the European country with the highest official number of Covid fatalities, as its new total of 64,036 deaths overtook Britain, according to an Agence France-Presse tally. The Italian health ministry said that 649 people had died from the virus in the previous 24 hours and that 19,903 new cases had been diagnosed. Worldwide, the US has reported the highest number of Covid-19 deaths, with 295,539 as of Saturday morning, followed by Brazil, India and Mexico. According to the AFP tally for Europe, Italy overtook Britain, which has reported 64,026 deaths and is followed by France with 57,567 and Spain with 47,624. Italy was the first European country to suffer a wave of infections earlier this year. The UK’s toll overtook that of Italy on 6 May, with close to 30,000 fatalities, and for a while over the summer the southern European nation appeared to have weathered the storm. But despite the introduction of mass testing, cases began rising again in early autumn, as they did in many other nations - and deaths inevitably followed. Italy’s national medical association said Friday that a total of 251 doctors have now died from the virus. \"In this second wave, it is mainly general practitioners who are paying the highest toll,\" warned Filippo Anelli, head of the FNOMCeO association. He blamed \"greater circulation\" of asymptomatic patients, but added that all doctors did not have the necessary protective equipment. \"We must put an end to this massacre,\" he said.",

Two weeks ago, Costa had said people would be able to return home before a 2am curfew on New Year’s Eve. But a previously announced reevaluation of measures took into consideration the current pandemic situation and forced the government to take a step back. \"The number of cases per week are dropping but not as fast as they were before,\" Costa said, explaining the government decided to toughen New Year’s Eve measures so rules over Christmas were not as severe. There is no limit on how many people can gather per household for Christmas and a ban on domestic travel will not be imposed between 23-26 December. \"Christmas celebrations have to be carried out with the utmost care,\" he said, urging people to avoid poorly ventilated spaces and to use face masks during family gatherings whenever possible. After a relatively mild first wave of the disease compared with countries such as Spain or Italy, Portugal has had a record number of infections and deaths during the second wave though the daily tally has dropped slightly in recent weeks. Portugal, which has a population of just over 10 million, has recorded 362,616 confirmed cases of Covid-19 and 5,902 deaths.",

        "news": "A Brazilian lab said it has detected two cases of the new coronavirus variant that has spread rapidly in Britain, and urged reinforcement of quarantine measures for travellers coming from Europe. Diagnostic medicine company Dasa said it had detected the SARS-CoV-2 strain B.1.1.7 through genetic sequencing done in partnership with Sao Paulo university’s tropical medicine institute. \"Sequencing confirmed that the new strain of the virus has arrived in Brazil,\" said researcher Ester Sabino at the tropical medicine institute. The new variant has rapidly become the dominant strain in cases of Covid-19 in parts of southern England, and has been linked to an increase in hospitalisation rates. Australia, Italy and the Netherlands say they detected cases of the new strain. Scientists say that, while it is not more lethal than the original strain, it is significantly more transmissible. \"Given its high transmission power, this result reinforces the importance of quarantine, and of maintaining isolation for 10 days, especially for those who are coming or just arrived from Europe,\" Sabino said.",

Canadians in the city received an email from their government’s foreign ministry saying a plane was expected to leave on 6 February, according to a report by the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation. However, a Canadian government source said the Chinese government had yet to give final consent for the flight, Reuters says. Residents of Wuhan and Hubei have been under quarantine for a few weeks as China attempts to contain the spread of the virus. According to a portion of the letter the CBC posted online, not everyone who is eligible for a seat will get one. Canadian evacuees will be flown first to Vancouver, where the plane will refuel, and then on to Trenton Air Force base in southern Ontario, where they will be placed in quarantine for 14 days.",

        "news": "China has ordered three reporters from American newspaper the Wall Street Journal to leave the country, over what Beijing deemed a racist headline. The expulsion came as Beijing slammed Washington’s decision to tighten rules on Chinese state media organisations in the United States, calling the move \"unreasonable and unacceptable\", AFP reports. A Chinese foreign ministry spokesman Geng Shuang said the Journal op-ed - titled \"China is the Real Sick Man of Asia\" - had a \"racially discriminatory\" and \"sensational\" headline, and slammed the newspaper for not issuing an official apology. Geng told a press briefing: As such, China has decided that from today, the press cards of three Wall Street Journal reporters in Beijing will be revoked. The Journal reported that deputy bureau chief Josh Chin and reporter Chao Deng, both US nationals, as well as reporter Philip Wen, an Australian, had been ordered to leave the country in five days. The three journalists are in the Wall Street Journal’s news section, which is not linked to the editorial and opinion section. The op-ed, written by Bard College professor Walter Russell Mead, criticised the Chinese government’s initial response to the new coronavirus outbreak. It called the Wuhan city government \"secretive and self-serving\", while dismissing national efforts as ineffective. The phrase \"sick man of Asia\" originally referred to China in the late 19th and early 20th century, when it was exploited by foreign powers during a period sometimes called the country’s \"century of humiliation\". The 3 February piece \"slandered the efforts of the Chinese government and the Chinese people to fight the epidemic\", said Geng. The new coronavirus epidemic has killed over 2,000 people in China and infected more than 74,000, and has spread to at least two dozen countries. \"The editors of the Wall Street Journal have nailed themselves to the pillar of shame,\" wrote the nationalistic Global Times in an op-ed on Tuesday before the reporters were expelled. The WSJ’s remarks \"sound like gloating, and they disgust Chinese people\", it said. The expulsions come a day after the United States angered China for classifying five state media outlets, including Xinhua news agency and the China Global Television Network, as foreign missions, with State Department officials saying they were part of Beijing’s growing \"propaganda\" apparatus. Voicing China’s \"strong dissatisfaction\", Geng added cryptically: \"We reserve the right to respond further to this matter.\"",

That has given us a blueprint for building on that for the new arrival of guests. I was pleased for the staff and partners who had spent such lot of time making sure their stay was as comfortable as possible and clearly I think because we did such a good job we were asked to support this group of travellers that are coming back from a cruise in Japan. The group of people is slightly different. Obviously they have come from a cruise ship rather than from their own homes over in China but we are working exactly the same as we did before with the healthcare professionals and Public Health England to make sure they are safe, well managed and comfortable while they are with us.

On Sunday, Pompeo said: \"There is enormous evidence that that’s where this began,\" later adding: \"I can tell you that there is a significant amount of evidence that this came from that laboratory in Wuhan.\" At one point, the secretary of state appeared confused over whether he was claiming the Sars-CoV-2 virus (which causes the Covid-19 disease) was deliberately engineered or escaped as the result of a lab accident. \"Look, the best experts so far seem to think it was manmade. I have no reason to disbelieve that at this point,\" he said.

Andrew Parker who was the director general of MI5 until two and half weeks ago, told a webinar: I’m just not aware of any evidence that it is anything other than what people think it is: It came via markets. There are all sorts of hypotheses around, but I just think it is not useful to speculate, worry about all that. The former British spy chief said it was the business of intelligence agencies to find out if there was ever a point when a state or non-state actor was trying to deliberately spread a dangerous disease. In that case, he said, there \"should be an expectation that the agencies will somehow uncover that\". But, in remarks that could have been addressed directly to the US president Donald Trump or the secretary of state Mike Pompeo, Parker concluded: Conspiracy theories right now are not helpful. Both Trump and Pompeo have publicly pushed the lab leak theory without offering supporting evidence. British intelligence agencies have been saying for the past couple of weeks they don’t subscribe to the lab leak theory, although the idea is nevertheless being pushed in news media in the UK, US and Australia.

        "news": "Brazil has reported a record increase in cases, with its ministry of health confirming 6,276 more infections in a 24-hour period, taking the country’s total to 78,162. It has also suffered another 449 deaths in that time, raising its toll to at least 5,466 people since the outbreak began. Health specialists believe the real numbers are much higher. Brazil’s far-right president Jair Bolsonaro has dismissed the rising death toll and, in recent weeks, has insisted the virus was \"going away\". He shrugged off Tuesday’s news that the official Brazilian total had surpassed the WHO-reported death toll in China, saying: \"So what? I’m sorry. What do you want me to do?\" Now, he has sought to blame state governors and mayors for the deaths – even though they have introduced social distancing measures against his orders while he repeatedly mingled with supporters and other Brazilians. He argued that they should be asked why they \"took such restrictive measures and people kept dying\" and told reporters: \"You won’t put that bill on my lap.\" Asked what responsibility he held for rising deaths, he replied: \"The question is so idiotic I’m not going to reply.\"",

        "news": "Brazil’s president Jair Bolsonaro said he will sign off a 60 billion-real ($10.72 billion) federal aid programme for states and cities hit by coronavirus, but asked governors for support freezing public sector pay increases. The bill to distribute federal money to states and municipalities was approved by Congress earlier this month. However, Bolsonaro has not signed off on it due to pressure from economy minister Paulo Guedes, who is pushing for more fiscal austerity, Reuters reports. Bolsonaro is under growing pressure for his handling of the outbreak, which looks set to cripple the Brazilian economy and threatens his re-election hopes. In the coming days, Brazil is likely to become the world’s second-worst affected country, behind only to the United States. Nearly 19,000 have died so far from the virus in Brazil, with 291,579 confirmed cases. The true number of infections and deaths is likely to be higher as Brazil has not been carrying out widespread testing. Bolsonaro’s relationship with governors and mayors has grown increasingly bitter. The president is angry over shutdowns they have implemented to stop the virus’ spread and argues that keeping the economy running is more important. In return for signing off on the aid package, Bolsonaro asked governors for their backing in specific measures freezing public sector pay increases for two years.",

Brazil registered 1,001 daily coronavirus deaths on Friday, taking the total deaths to 21,048, according to the health ministry. However, the true numbers – both of cases and deaths – is probably higher as Latin America’s top economy has been slow to ramp up testing. Meanwhile Brazil’s environment minister, Ricardo Salles, called on the government to push through further deregulation of environmental policy while people are distracted by the coronavirus pandemic, in a video the supreme court ordered to be released. The video of a ministers’ meeting surfaced in an investigation of whether the president, Jair Bolsonaro, interfered in appointing leaders of the federal police for personal gain. During the meeting, other ministers spoke, including Salles, with environmental groups saying his remarks prove that the Bolsonaro government is systematically seeking to dismantle environmental protections. \"We need to make an effort while we are in this calm moment in terms of press coverage, because they are only talking about Covid, and push through and change all the rules and simplify norms,\" Salles said in the video. Deforestation hit an 11-year high last year and has increased 55% in the first four months of the year, compared with a year ago, with environmentalists blaming Bolsonaro’s policies.",

        "news": "Brazil has drawn further criticism for its handling of the coronavirus pandemic after sharing contradictory figures on deaths and infections, intensifying a scandal over the country’s Covid-19 data. A senator called for a congressional inquiry and the discrepancy prompted criticism from across the political spectrum after initial health ministry data on Brazil’s number of cases and death toll was contradicted by numbers uploaded to the ministry’s online data portal. On Monday, the ministry said in a statement the discrepancy was predominantly due to mistakes in the numbers from two states that were later corrected. It explained that the later, lower daily death toll of 525 was the correct one. Senator Eliziane Gama, leader of centrist party Citizenship, asked the Senate to open an inquiry into the numbers, while the WHO stressed the importance of \"consistent and transparent\" communication from Brazil. It ranks second in confirmed cases, behind the United States, and its death toll last week surpassed Italy’s. The discrepancy followed recent decisions to remove from a national website a trove of data about the country’s outbreak, and to push back the daily release of new numbers late into the evening and after the country’s main television news program. Brazil could see Covid-19 deaths rise to 165,960 by August, above the forecast for the United States which has 100 million more people, according to a new projection by the University of Washington’s Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation.The updated forecast suggests Brazil’s epidemic could become the most lethal globally. For Carlos Machado, head of research at the National School of Public Health, part of the respected public institute Oswaldo Cruz Foundation, the lack of dependable data in Brazil is dangerous. \"Not having updated and reliable data during a pandemic of this proportion is like driving in the dark,\" he said. \"While we do not have a vaccine, information is the best weapon we have.\" \"By changing the numbers, the ministry of health covers the sun with a sieve,\" Rodrigo Maia, speaker of the lower house, said on Twitter. \"The credibility of the statistics needs to be urgently recovered. A ministry that manipulates numbers creates a parallel world in order not to face the reality of the facts.\" According to the council, Brazil had recorded 680,456 cases of Covid-19 and 36,151 deaths from the disease by the end of Sunday afternoon.",

        "title": "FDA revokes emergency use of malaria drug Trump touted as coronavirus treatment",
        "news": "The US Food and Drug Administration has revoked its emergency use authorisation for hydroxychloroquine to treat Covid-19, the drug championed by president Donald Trump. Based on new evidence, the FDA said it was no longer reasonable to believe that oral formulations of hydroxychloroquine and the related drug chloroquine may be effective in treating the illness caused by the coronavirus. The move comes after several studies of the decades-old malaria drug suggested it was not effective, including a widely anticipated trial earlier this month that showed it failed to prevent infection in people who had been exposed to the virus. The drug’s anti-inflammatory and antiviral properties suggested it might help treat Covid-19, and the FDA authorised its emergency use in March. While it did appear to neutralise the virus in laboratory experiments, hydroxychloroquine, which is also used to treat lupus and rheumatoid arthritis, has failed to prove its worth in human Covid-19 trials, thus far. In March, Trump said hydroxychloroquine used in combination with the antibiotic azithromycin had \"a real chance to be one of the biggest game changers in the history of medicine,\" with little evidence to back up that claim. He later said he took the drugs preventively after two people who worked at the White House were diagnosed with Covid-19, and he urged others to try it. Doctors in recent weeks had already pulled back on the use of hydroxychloroquine as a Covid-19 treatment, after several studies suggested it is not effective and may pose heart risks for certain patients. France, Italy and Belgium late last month moved to halt the use of hydroxychloroquine to treat Covid-19 patients. But the United States last month supplied Brazil with 2m doses for use against Covid-19, as the South American country has emerged as the pandemic’s latest epicenter. Meanwhile, some 400 trials are listed as using hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine as interventions for Covid-19, more than half of them still ongoing, according to a recent analysis from research firm GlobalData. In the United States, the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases last month launched a trial designed to show whether hydroxychloroquine in combination with azithromycin can prevent hospitalisation and death from Covid-19.",

        "news": "Chile´s government said on Monday it would extend a state of catastrophe in place since mid-March by 90 days, in response to a surge in infections in the South American nation. The pace of new infections has increased dramatically in May and June, averaging over 5,000 daily in recent weeks, filling critical care wards and prompting authorities to declare a full lockdown in the capital Santiago, a city of more than six million. The state of catastrophe, extended by presidential decree, gives the government extraordinary powers to restrict freedom of movement and assure food supply and basic services, Reuters reports. Quarantine measures are routinely enforced by soldiers in Santiago. South America has become the new epicenter of the global coronavirus crisis, with Peru, Brazil and Chile particularly hard hit. Chile has recorded nearly 180,000 infections and more than 3,300 people have died, according to a Reuters tally. Chile´s interior minister Gonzalo Blumel said most Chileans were abiding by increasingly draconian restrictions on movement, but that \"a group of people acting irresponsibly are not complying.\" Blumel said the government would now seek jail time for the most egregious of violations. On Sunday, the new health minister Enrique Paris had announced that the country’s official death toll will include suspected cases, which could double the current figure.",

The decision to quarantine the president – whose popularity is riding high on his no-nonsense response to the pandemic – was taken due to the \"significant increase in the circulation of the virus,\" presidential doctor Federico Saavedra said in a statement on Wednesday. Until now, Argentina’s strong coronavirus lockdown, had been a standout success in the containment of the pandemic that is ripping through its South American neighbours Brazil and Chile.

Bolsonaro, sometimes called the \"Tropical Trump,\" has been widely criticised for his handling of the crisis. The country still has no permanent health minister after losing two since April, following clashes with the president. Bolsonaro has shunned social distancing, calling it a job-killing measure more dangerous than the virus itself.

The far-right populist, whose dismissive response to the pandemic has been globally condemned, first announced he had been diagnosed with Covid-19 in early July, when Brazil had suffered more than 65,000 deaths and 1.6m confirmed cases.Since then Brazil’s death toll has risen to nearly 83,000 - the second highest in the world – and the number of cases to 2.2m, a record 67,860 of which were recorded yesterday.Brazil’s president again tested positive for the coronavirus on Wednesday and has supposedly been in isolation since 6 July. Despite that Bolsonaro – who has undermined social distancing efforts and repeatedly downplayed the illness as a \"bit of a cold\" – was on Thursday spotted by a Reuters photographer roaming the estate around Brasília’s Palácio da Alvorada on a motorbike and talking to cleaners without gear to protect them.",

President Jair Bolsonaro has pressed to reopen the Brazilian economy, with lockdowns lifting in many cities despite the toll of the disease continuing to rise. In some cases, Brazilians have packed into bars and crowded public squares, often in defiance of local rules. Bolsonaro himself has flouted social distancing guidelines by joining supporters at rallies around Brasilia, the capital, in recent months. He fell ill with coronavirus this month, and spent weeks in partial isolation before recovering. The right-wing populist has argued the economic damage from lockdowns is worse than the disease itself, which he has played down as \"a little flu\" that can be cured by unproven treatments, involving the anti-malarial drug hydroxychloroquine.",

With nearly 4 million confirmed cases, the virus has killed over 120,000 people in Brazil. But the level of average daily deaths dropped below 900 per day last week - the lowest in three and a half months and below the rate of both the United States and India, according to a Reuters tally.Researchers at Imperial College London also calculate that the transmission rate in Brazil, at which each person infected with the coronavirus infects another person, is now below 1, the level required for new infections to slow. However, the rate previously fell below 1 in August, only to rebound a week later, according to Imperial.The government statistics are also volatile. On Tuesday and Wednesday, Brazil registered more than 1,100 deaths each day, and experts say it is too early to say the worst is over.\"We are on a downward trend compared to the previous high plateau,\" said Roberto Medronho, an infectious diseases expert at the Federal University of Rio de Janeiro. \"But, the numbers are still high and we have to remain vigilant so that it doesn’t grow again.\"",

        "news": "Global coronavirus cases rose by more than 400,000 for the first time late on Friday, a record one-day increase as much of Europe enacts new restrictions to curb the outbreak. Europe, which successfully damped down the first surge of infections, has emerged as the new coronavirus epicentre in recent weeks and is reporting on average 140,000 cases a day over the past week. As a region, Europe is reporting more daily cases than India, Brazil and the US combined. Of every 100 infections reported around the world, 34 were from European countries, according to a Reuters analysis. The region is currently reporting a million new infections about every nine days and has reported more than 6.3 million cases since the pandemic began. Major European countries - the UK, France, Russia, the Netherlands and Spain - accounted for about half of Europe’s new cases in the week to 18 October. France is reporting the highest seven-day average of new cases in Europe with 19,425 infections per day followed by the United Kingdom, Russia, Spain and the Netherlands in the list of worst affected European countries. Several European countries are closing schools, cancelling elective surgeries and enlisting student medics as the authorities face a Covid-19 resurgence. Russia is moving students to online learning and Northern Ireland is closing schools for two weeks and restaurants for four. In Spain, authorities in Catalonia ordered bars and restaurants to close for 15 days and limited the numbers of people allowed in shops. The Czech Republic has also shifted schools to distance learning and plans to call up thousands of medical students. Hospitals are cutting non-urgent medical procedures to free up beds. Polish health officials have warned the country is on the brink of a disaster as a record 6,526 new coronavirus infections and 116 deaths were reported this week. Poland is ramping up training for nurses and considering creating military field hospitals. Latin America is the worst-affected region with about 27% of total Covid-19 cases followed by Asia, North America and Europe. India is reporting fewer cases this month compared with September, with 69,000 cases per day. The numbers have fallen by more than 20,400 over the last three weeks, down 22% from its previous peak. India reported 55,342 cases on 13 October, its lowest daily increase since 18 August. In the US, which has the largest total number of cases and deaths in the world, new infections are edging higher along with the most hospitalised Covid-19 patients since early September.",

        "news": "Italy on Saturday became the European country with the highest official number of Covid fatalities, as its new total of 64,036 deaths overtook Britain, according to an Agence France-Presse tally. The Italian health ministry said that 649 people had died from the virus in the previous 24 hours and that 19,903 new cases had been diagnosed. Worldwide, the US has reported the highest number of Covid-19 deaths, with 295,539 as of Saturday morning, followed by Brazil, India and Mexico. According to the AFP tally for Europe, Italy overtook Britain, which has reported 64,026 deaths and is followed by France with 57,567 and Spain with 47,624. Italy was the first European country to suffer a wave of infections earlier this year. The UK’s toll overtook that of Italy on 6 May, with close to 30,000 fatalities, and for a while over the summer the southern European nation appeared to have weathered the storm. But despite the introduction of mass testing, cases began rising again in early autumn, as they did in many other nations - and deaths inevitably followed. Italy’s national medical association said Friday that a total of 251 doctors have now died from the virus. \"In this second wave, it is mainly general practitioners who are paying the highest toll,\" warned Filippo Anelli, head of the FNOMCeO association. He blamed \"greater circulation\" of asymptomatic patients, but added that all doctors did not have the necessary protective equipment. \"We must put an end to this massacre,\" he said.",

The Andean country, which has had a total of 1,468,795 confirmed cases and 39,787 deaths, recorded 12,196 new cases on Thursday. The figure was the highest since 19 August, when there were 13,055 new cases. President Iván Duque and health officials have repeatedly warned Colombians against gathering in crowds at shopping areas and urged them to keep family celebrations limited in order to reduce spread of the virus. Duque on Wednesday said rising cases numbers could be traced to celebrations to mark the feast of the Immaculate Conception - known locally as Night of the Candles - when families gather to put candles in their windows or outside their homes. The daily death toll also rose past 200 on Wednesday and Thursday, reaching 204 and 227 respectively. Daily new recorded deaths have not surpassed 200 since September. Colombia expects to vaccinate about 15 million people against Covid-19 in 2021, including health care workers, those over 60 and those with pre-existing conditions. Intensive care units in Bogotá, a centre for infection, were at 74% capacity on Thursday, according to local health department figures.

        "news": "British drugmaker AstraZeneca told Reuters its Covid-19 vaccine should be effective against the new coronavirus variant, adding studies were underway to fully probe the impact of the mutation. \"AZD1222 (AstraZeneca’s vaccine candidate) contains the genetic material of the SARS-CoV-2 virus spike protein, and the changes to the genetic code seen in this new viral strain do not appear to change the structure of the spike protein,\" an AstraZeneca representative said. Drugmakers are scrambling to test their Covid-19 vaccines against the new fast-spreading variant of the virus that is spreading in Britain, the latest challenge in the breakneck race to curb the pandemic. \"Through vaccination with AZD1222, the body’s immune system is trained to recognise many different parts of the spike protein, so that it can eliminate the virus if it is later exposed,\" the AstraZeneca representative added. The mutation, known as the B.1.1.7 lineage, may be up to 70% more infectious and more of a concern for children. It has sown chaos in Britain, prompting a wave of travel bans that are disrupting trade with Europe. The AstraZeneca-Oxford shot is considered vital for lower-income countries and those in hot climates because it is cheaper, easier to transport and can be stored for long periods at normal refrigerator temperatures. Data from AstraZeneca’s late-stage trials in the UK and Brazil released earlier this month showed the vaccine had efficacy of 62% for trial participants given two full doses, but 90% for a smaller sub-group given a half, then a full dose. Reuters reported late on Tuesday that India is likely to approve AstraZeneca’s vaccine for emergency use by next week.",

        "news": "A Brazilian lab said it has detected two cases of the new coronavirus variant that has spread rapidly in Britain, and urged reinforcement of quarantine measures for travellers coming from Europe. Diagnostic medicine company Dasa said it had detected the SARS-CoV-2 strain B.1.1.7 through genetic sequencing done in partnership with Sao Paulo university’s tropical medicine institute. \"Sequencing confirmed that the new strain of the virus has arrived in Brazil,\" said researcher Ester Sabino at the tropical medicine institute. The new variant has rapidly become the dominant strain in cases of Covid-19 in parts of southern England, and has been linked to an increase in hospitalisation rates. Australia, Italy and the Netherlands say they detected cases of the new strain. Scientists say that, while it is not more lethal than the original strain, it is significantly more transmissible. \"Given its high transmission power, this result reinforces the importance of quarantine, and of maintaining isolation for 10 days, especially for those who are coming or just arrived from Europe,\" Sabino said.",

Stocks are still struggling but he rings the alarm on an apparent freeze in lending: The most concerning thing is the fact that credit markets froze. In very unusual trading there were no new corporate bonds issued in Europe or the USA. This last occurred on a non-holiday in 2007, just before the global peak in equity markets and the plunge that heralded the GFC. In Australia, BIS Oxford Economics have said that weak capex figures for the fourth quarter released on Thursday morning makes it more likely that the Reserve Bank will have to reduce rates or introduce some kind of monetary easing. The data confirm our view that capex growth this year will be soft, and is very likely to miss the RBA’s forecast – as the survey was done in Q4 it does not include any additional drag from the coronavirus outbreak. We continue to expect further monetary easing, and the pressure will mount on the government to loosen policy in its May budget. Aust capex plans for 2020-21 are +8.8% on plans a yr ago for 2019-20 (first chart) due to a 28% uplift in mining inv plans. Non-mining plans remain weak (second chart).

Michael McCarthy of CMC Markets in Sydney said a number of factors were behind the big lift and that it was not just theresult of the US Fed’s rate cut on Tuesday. A Congressional spending package, the rise of Joe Biden and stronger than forecast data lifted US optimism and sent stocks soaring. Major share indices leapt 4% overnight.

From Monday, mass-gatherings of more than 500 people will banned, but will not include schools and universities. Until Friday Morrison insisted he would go to the football to see the Shark’s first NRL match, drawing criticism from his opponents and some public health workers. Morrison said: \"‘The fact that I would still be going on Saturday speaks not just to my passion for my beloved Sharks; it might be the last game I get to go to for a long time\". Following public pressure Morrison has now said he will not attend the game. On Saturday morning Bowen said Morrison had displayed \"a gob-smacking lack of judgement\". He said the public were tired of mixed-messaging from the federal government; I understand many people are disappointed about various events, but as I said, tough decisions now avoid much tougher times later. I was disappointed, in fact gobsmacked that the prime minister indicated he would still be attending the football after the advice from active medical officers. Yes, the advice only formally comes into effect on Monday, but leadership is about more than rules and regulations. It is about being the example you set. I understand Scott Morrison wanted to go to the football... I wanted to go to the football as well. But as soon as that advice was clear, I thought it was a gobsmacking lack of judgement for Scott Morrison to continue to go to the football, sending a terrible signal and message to the Australian people. On Australia’s home affairs minister Peter Dutton being tested with coronavirus, Bowen said; \"We wish him the best, this is not a pleasant disease\". However, Bowen said there was \"a lack of information before the Australian people, and this confusion makes it worse\".

The only exception is for essential services, like health workers. The penalty for breaching this mandatory self-isolation is a fine of up to AUD$16,800 (£8,366) or six months jail. Gutwein said: I think it is an extra layer of protection on Tasmanians. This will be, in Tasmania, the strongest border measures in the country in terms of the states and territories... But I want to make it clear as well: any Tasmanian can still come home. If they come home after midnight on Friday, they will need to go into a two-week quarantine.

Andrew Parker who was the director general of MI5 until two and half weeks ago, told a webinar: I’m just not aware of any evidence that it is anything other than what people think it is: It came via markets. There are all sorts of hypotheses around, but I just think it is not useful to speculate, worry about all that. The former British spy chief said it was the business of intelligence agencies to find out if there was ever a point when a state or non-state actor was trying to deliberately spread a dangerous disease. In that case, he said, there \"should be an expectation that the agencies will somehow uncover that\". But, in remarks that could have been addressed directly to the US president Donald Trump or the secretary of state Mike Pompeo, Parker concluded: Conspiracy theories right now are not helpful. Both Trump and Pompeo have publicly pushed the lab leak theory without offering supporting evidence. British intelligence agencies have been saying for the past couple of weeks they don’t subscribe to the lab leak theory, although the idea is nevertheless being pushed in news media in the UK, US and Australia.

Australia’s chief medical officer, Prof Brendan Murphy, said on Friday, \"These sort of events really are dangerous\". However the prime minister, Scott Morrison, announced on the same day that major sports stadiums may allow 10,000 people by July.It follows protests last weekend, when people took to the streets campaigning for an end to Aboriginal deaths in custody. There have been 437 known Aboriginal deaths since the royal commission into Aboriginal deaths in custody delivered its final report in 1991, and yet despite this, change has been slow. The protests were sparked in solidarity with the US following the brutal death of unarmed man George Floyd on 25 May. One man was diagnosed with the virus following the Melbourne protests, with health authorities saying he was likely infected prior to the rally. Victoria police issued fines of $1652 each to the three people who organised the protest. More protests took place in Sydney and Perth on Friday night. About 300 people who gathered in Sydney’s city were outnumbered by about 600 police officers, in an event deemed unlawful because police were not formally notified. The peaceful protest was also brief, ending around 8pm. Two stray observations from today’s protest:1) These guys were already there, protecting the Captain Cook statue - which nobody else ended up going near 2) Saw a few commercial TV reporters and crew who clearly have started hiring their own security  Thousands of protesters will gather in Perth for Saturday’s protest at Langley Park. Organisers have ignored Premier Mark McGowan’s pleas to delay the protest until after the coronavirus pandemic is over. Meanwhile, refugee activists will spread themselves out in Melbourne in an attempt to avoid the same fines issued to the organisers of last weekend’s rally. The group said its rallies will have no more than 20 people in eight different locations to protest against the indefinite detention of asylum seekers.",

Bordering states -- especially New South Wales -- are on high alert after the Victorian premier, Daniel Andrews, announced a record new 288 cases on Friday– the single highest daily rise in any state since the pandemic began. He warned those numbers would increase in the coming days. The lockdown led the government to announce a half-a-billion-dollar stimulus package for affected businesses. Andrews also said Melbourne would stop taking international flight arrivals for at least two weeks, while it worked to get the outbreak under control. There are now 47 people in hospital in the state, including 12 in intensive care. The vast majority of the 288 new cases have been locally acquired. By comparison, New South Wales reported just 14 new cases on Friday, with 12 of those in returned travellers now in hotel quarantine. Meanwhile to ensure more cases of the virus aren’t imported while Victoria grapples to regain control, Australia’s national cabinet, made up of the prime minister and state and territory leaders, decided to cap the number of incoming flights allowed in Australia. The change means at least 4,000 fewer Australians will return home each week. The prime minister, Scott Morrison, acknowledged the change meant \"it will be more difficult\" for Australians to return home. The New South Wales chief health officer Dr Kerry Chant urged the community to be extra vigilant following the closure of the Victorian/ New South Wales border to stop spread of the virus on Wednesday. The border will remain shut for at least six weeks, the first time it has been closed in more than 100 years.",

Tensions between the two countries have been escalating on various fronts after Beijing reacted with fury to calls for an independent investigation into the origins and spread of the pandemic, which first surfaced in central China last year. Apart from warning of discrimination recently, China’s culture and tourism ministry advised against travelling to Australia last month due to increasing racism linked to the virus. On Monday, the foreign ministry said that \"racial discrimination and acts of violence in Australia have significantly increased\", accusing Australian media of fanning the flames of anti-Chinese sentiment. The Chinese foreign ministry’s latest notice also came days after Australia offered about 10,000 people from Hong Kong pathways to permanent residency in response to China’s crackdown on dissent in the city, encouraging entrepreneurs or skilled workers to relocate as well. The moves drew ire from Beijing. \"Australia’s relevant law enforcement authorities arbitrarily search Chinese citizens and seize their items, and these circumstances could cause harm to Chinese citizens in Australia, as well as the safety of their assets,\" said the ministry. The notice posted on the WeChat social media app also reminded Chinese citizens to \"pay close attention\" to local safety risks and \"travel with caution to Australia in the near-term\". Responding to questions on Australia’s latest announcements about Hong Kong, foreign ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying warned at a regular briefing that Australia’s moves could bring negative consequences. We urge Australia to change its course and stop interfering in Hong Kong’s affairs and China’s internal affairs in any way, or risk further damage to China-Australia relations.",

As Australia wakes on Saturday morning, the focus will again be on the southern state of Victoria, which now accounts for the majority of cases of coronavirus and Covid-19 deaths in Australia. On Friday, Victoria reported 300 new cases of coronavirus and seven deaths. There are warnings the number of deaths could increase substantially over the coming days. The next few days will be crucial to see if Victoria has again flattened the curve. The Victorian premier, Daniel Andrews, has warned that those waiting for test results will be door-knocked by the army if they fail to answer calls from health officials. In New South Wales, there were fewer than 10 cases reported on Friday. NSW Health issued a warning late on Friday evening after a woman in her 40s tested positive after she had attended church services in Bankstown and Fairfield between 16 and 18 July. These are the locations, and they have warned people should isolate if they were there around the same time and have symptoms:",

There are now seven active cases linked to the youth detention centre.

For the rest of the state it is limited to 30 people. Palaszczuk said she expects more cases could be linked to the cluster but they are waiting for the test results to come back. She says staff and children at the centre are \"well looked after\". The state is still currently not accepting visitors from NSW, the ACT and Victoria. In the southern state of Victoria, there is hope the state has passed the peak of its second wave, with daily case numbers dropping below 200 for the first time since 13 July. Also a cause of hope was the fact that just 24 of those cases were so-called \"mystery cases\" where the source of the infection is unknown.

        "news": "The Australian prime minister, Scott Morrison, is standing firm on his calls for the independent investigation into the origins of the coronavirus and urged all nations to share a vaccine once it is proven. Morrison’s pre-recorded speech on the virtual stage on Saturday morning to the 75th United Nations general assembly, praised the World Health Organization for establishing an inquiry into the global response to coronavirus, AAP reports. \"There is also a clear mandate to identify the zoonotic source of the Covid-19 virus and how it was transmitted to humans,\" he said. \"This virus has inflicted a calamity on our world and its peoples. We must do all we can to understand what happened for no other purpose than to prevent it from happening again.\" The inquiry resolution backed by 145 countries in May does not mention China, instead committing to an impartial, independent and comprehensive evaluation. China eventually supported the European Union motion. Ties between the two nations have since been fraught, with tariffs being imposed on some goods and Australian journalists being evacuated from China. Morrison urged other leaders to share a coronavirus vaccine if they discover one. He has previously said if Australia found a vaccine, it would be shared across the world. \"This is a global responsibility and it’s a moral responsibility for a vaccine to be shared far and wide,\" he said. \"Some might see short-term advantage or even profit. But I assure you to anyone who may think along those lines, humanity will have a very long memory and be a very, very severe judge.\"",

        "news": "After increasing pressure on the Victorian government and its health minister, Jenny Mikakos, due to failures of the state’s hotel quarantine program, Mikakos resigned on Saturday morning. My media statement is attached. #springst It follows a six-week inquiry into the state’s hotel quarantine program for returned international travellers, with infection control failures in the program ultimately sparking Victoria’s second wave. Much of the state is now under strict lockdown restrictions, and borders to other Australian states remain closed or heavily restricted. While most other states and territories opted to use police officer or Australian Defence Force [ADF] staff to implement the hotel quarantine program, Victoria used private security contractors who were poorly trained in infection control, the inquiry previously heard. The premier and health minister have been under pressure to explain why ADF and police were not used. As Guardian Australia reporter Josh Taylor wrote on Friday; In his long-awaited appearance at the hotel quarantine inquiry, Victorian premier Daniel Andrews said he regarded his health minister, Jenny Mikakos, as \"accountable for the program\". The premier’s written statement provided to the inquiry on Friday said Mikakos and jobs minister Martin Pakula were responsible for informing cabinet about the program, and the pair provided a submission on the model for the program to the crisis council of cabinet on 8 April. \"The CCC [crisis council of cabinet] was provided with regular reports by Minister Mikakos containing data relevant to Victoria’s response to the public health emergency, key insights from the data, as well as other updates, including in relation to the program,\" the submission read. The premier stopped short of saying who was behind the decision to use private security guards, but the claim potentially puts Andrews at odds with health minister Jenny Mikakos. The health minister’s statements to the inquiry on Thursday said she was not aware security guards were used in the program until the outbreak at the Rydges Hotel in late May. Mikakos released a statement to the inquiry after Andrews’ submission was released denying she had misled the inquiry. The premier told the inquiry it was \"very disappointing\" that the decision on private security guards was supposedly made by a \"collective\" of officials, with no one taking responsibility. In her resignation letter to the premier on Saturday, Mikakos wrote; \"I am disappointed that my integrity has sought to be undermined\". \"I have today written to the Governor of Victoria to resign my commissions as a minister effective today.\" Mikakos also intends to resign from parliament.",

The Victorian premier, Daniel Andrews, is expected to give a further update this morning in what will be his 100th consecutive day of fronting up to the media. Melbourne has been in a hard lockdown since early July as the state experienced a second wave of the coronavirus. While restrictions have eased in regional areas of the state, in the city a five-kilometre movement restriction for only essential travel and gathering bans remain. That lockdown will stay unless the city’s rolling 14-day average drops to five cases or less, with only five cases of community transmission over that same time. The average right now is 9.4. On Friday the state recorded 11 cases and no deaths. In NSW, that state recorded five new local cases on Friday but these were all linked to a known cluster. A health alert was issued late Friday when a nurse at St Vincent’s Hospital in Sydney tested posted. The nurse \"had limited contact with a very small number of colleagues\", health authorities said. The opening of state borders continues to create political tension in Australia. Queensland, which has only four people currently with the virus, is relatively open, and has its border closed to most of New South Wales and all of Victoria.

Victoria, the second most populous state, has accounted for more than 90% of the country’s 907 deaths. It reported two deaths in the past 24 hours.",

        "news": "Nearly one in four people may not get Covid-19 vaccines until at least 2022 because rich countries with less than 15% of the global population have reserved 51% of the doses of the most promising vaccines, researchers said. Low- and middle-income countries - home to more than 85% of the world’s population - would have to share the remainder, said researchers from the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health in the US. An effective response to the pandemic requires high-income countries \"to share in an equitable distribution of Covid-19 vaccines across the world\", they wrote. \"The uncertainty over global access to Covid-19 vaccines traces not only to ongoing clinical testing, but also from the failure of governments and vaccine manufacturers to be more transparent and accountable over these arrangements,\" they added. As of 15 November, high-income nations had pre-ordered nearly 7.5bn doses of vaccines from 13 manufacturers, the paper said. This included Japan, Australia and Canada who collectively have more than 1bn doses but accounted for less than 1% of current Covid-19 cases, it said. Even if leading manufacturers’ vaccines reach their projected maximum production capacity, nearly 25% of the world’s population may not get the vaccines for another year or more, according to the paper. The People’s Vaccine Alliance coalition last week said pharmaceutical companies should openly share their technology and intellectual property through the World Health Organization so that more doses can be manufactured. The John Hopkins researchers said WHO’s COVAX Facility could play a key role in ensuring fairer access to approved vaccines but it has only secured 500m doses, far below its target of delivering at least 2bn doses by the end of 2021. Launched in April, the global pact aims to pool funds from wealthier countries and nonprofits to accelerate the development and manufacture of Covid-19 vaccines and distribute them equitably around the world. It has so far secured half of the funding it needs and the US and Russia - key players in vaccine development and manufacture - have not joined, the Johns Hopkins study said.",

About a quarter of a million residents in the affected suburbs in Sydney have been asked to stay home for three days and people from outside areas urged not to visit as authorities set up more emergency testing centres. \"We’re bracing ourselves for more cases today, no doubt about that.... the next 24-48 hours will be critical,\" Berejiklian told the Australian Broadcasting Corp television. \"We’re taking this extremely seriously. We want to get on top of it as soon as we can, to give people as normal a Christmas as possible.\" Berejiklian said the original source of the virus was an international strain and that genomic experts were trying to find how it reached the local community. The number of coronavirus cases jumped to 17, authorities said late on Thursday just hours after reporting two new cases. New South Wales, of which Sydney is the capital, have been easing social distancing curbs in recent days due to low or no local cases. The new cluster has prompted other states to tighten their internal borders. Australia has reported just over 28,000 coronavirus cases and 908 deaths since the pandemic began and estimates most active cases in the country are returned overseas travellers in hotel quarantine.",

Diagnostic medicine company Dasa said it had detected the SARS-CoV-2 strain B.1.1.7 through genetic sequencing done in partnership with Sao Paulo university’s tropical medicine institute. \"Sequencing confirmed that the new strain of the virus has arrived in Brazil,\" said researcher Ester Sabino at the tropical medicine institute. The new variant has rapidly become the dominant strain in cases of Covid-19 in parts of southern England, and has been linked to an increase in hospitalisation rates. Australia, Italy and the Netherlands say they detected cases of the new strain. Scientists say that, while it is not more lethal than the original strain, it is significantly more transmissible. \"Given its high transmission power, this result reinforces the importance of quarantine, and of maintaining isolation for 10 days, especially for those who are coming or just arrived from Europe,\" Sabino said.",

        "news": "China has ordered three reporters from American newspaper the Wall Street Journal to leave the country, over what Beijing deemed a racist headline. The expulsion came as Beijing slammed Washington’s decision to tighten rules on Chinese state media organisations in the United States, calling the move \"unreasonable and unacceptable\", AFP reports. A Chinese foreign ministry spokesman Geng Shuang said the Journal op-ed - titled \"China is the Real Sick Man of Asia\" - had a \"racially discriminatory\" and \"sensational\" headline, and slammed the newspaper for not issuing an official apology. Geng told a press briefing: As such, China has decided that from today, the press cards of three Wall Street Journal reporters in Beijing will be revoked. The Journal reported that deputy bureau chief Josh Chin and reporter Chao Deng, both US nationals, as well as reporter Philip Wen, an Australian, had been ordered to leave the country in five days. The three journalists are in the Wall Street Journal’s news section, which is not linked to the editorial and opinion section. The op-ed, written by Bard College professor Walter Russell Mead, criticised the Chinese government’s initial response to the new coronavirus outbreak. It called the Wuhan city government \"secretive and self-serving\", while dismissing national efforts as ineffective. The phrase \"sick man of Asia\" originally referred to China in the late 19th and early 20th century, when it was exploited by foreign powers during a period sometimes called the country’s \"century of humiliation\". The 3 February piece \"slandered the efforts of the Chinese government and the Chinese people to fight the epidemic\", said Geng. The new coronavirus epidemic has killed over 2,000 people in China and infected more than 74,000, and has spread to at least two dozen countries. \"The editors of the Wall Street Journal have nailed themselves to the pillar of shame,\" wrote the nationalistic Global Times in an op-ed on Tuesday before the reporters were expelled. The WSJ’s remarks \"sound like gloating, and they disgust Chinese people\", it said. The expulsions come a day after the United States angered China for classifying five state media outlets, including Xinhua news agency and the China Global Television Network, as foreign missions, with State Department officials saying they were part of Beijing’s growing \"propaganda\" apparatus. Voicing China’s \"strong dissatisfaction\", Geng added cryptically: \"We reserve the right to respond further to this matter.\"",

The suspension will cover H-1B visas for skilled workers, H-2B visas for seasonal guest workers and other visa types, with an exception for workers in the food service industry, a senior official from the Trump administration said on Monday. President Donald Trump will also block L-1 visas for workers being transferred within a company through the end of the year, the official said, adding that the move would open up 525,000 jobs. Trump had previously hinted that he might extend a 60-day hold on green cards for foreign workers that he ordered to protect American jobs during the coronavirus outbreak. Analysts predict the number of green cards issued annually will drop from about 1 million to 300,000. The US dollar weakened and higher-risk currencies including the Australian dollar jumped on Monday as investors focused on the prospect for an eventual economic recovery from the coronavirus pandemic, Reuters reports. Traders bought riskier currencies even after signs of setbacks in the battle to contain the coronavirus.

NSW Health said the person attended the Flip Out Prestons Indoor Trampoline Park at the same time as a known case. The case attends Cabramatta High School, which will be closed over the weekend for cleaning. Contact tracing is underway. Authorities are calling on people south west Sydney to come forward for testing, citing a number of recent cases in the area.",

Those who test positive are obliged to remain in hotel quarantine until they have tested negative and been cleared by officials. The deputy chief health officer, Ben Cowie, told reporters on Saturday that symptomatic and non-symptomatic arrivals are separated almost immediately at the airport, with major precautions in place for those who are symptomatic. Meanwhile, the Victorian government on Saturday pledged that new $200 regional travel vouchers would be made available to residents after the first 40,000 vouchers offered through the scheme ran out.

        "news": "The UK prime minister’s chief political adviser, Dominic Cummings, and a data scientist he worked with on the Vote Leave campaign for Brexit are on the secret scientific group advising the government on the coronavirus pandemic, according to a list leaked to the Guardian. It reveals both Cummings and Ben Warner were among 23 attendees present at a crucial convening of the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage) on 23 March, the day Boris Johnson announced a nationwide lockdown in a televised address. Multiple attendees of Sage told the Guardian that both Cummings and Warner had been taking part in meetings of the group as far back as February. The inclusion of Downing Street advisers on Sage will raise questions about the independence of its scientific advice. There has been growing pressure on Downing Street in recent days to disclose more details about the group, which provides scientific advice to the upper echelons of government during emergencies. Both the membership of Sage and its advice to ministers on the Covid-19 outbreak is being kept secret. The government’s former chief scientific adviser Sir David King said he was \"shocked\" to discover there were political advisers on Sage. \"If you are giving science advice, your advice should be free of any political bias,\" he said. \"That is just so critically important.\" Told that Cummings was in the 23 March meeting, King replied: \"Oh my goodness. Isn’t this maybe why they don’t want us to know who was there?\"",

        "news": "Children aged five to 11 could return to school from Monday 1 June as part of government plans to gradually ease lockdown measures, the Sunday Telegraph has reported. Boris Johnson is to reveal the UK government’s plans to edge the country back to normal in an address next Sunday, according to the paper. It cited plans to ask companies to routinely test asymptomatic staff to isolate those who are infected and allow workplaces to reopen. Whitehall sources told the newspaper that pupils from Year’s 10 and 12 would form the first wave of secondary school children returning to school at a later date, so long as the current reduced infection rate holds. The earmarked date for return of primary schoolchildren – which will undoubtedly face questions – is said to be intended to minimise the threat to early development and help parents swiftly return to work. Schools have been closed for the vast majority of children since 23 March, but the children of key workers were allowed to continue going in. Schools in Ireland, which shares a land border with the UK, are to remain closed until September. The Sunday Times reports that the government will only tweak the lockdown this week, encouraging building sites to reopen, relaxing rules on outdoor activities and urging people to cover their faces on public transport. On Wednesday, the education secretary Gavin Williamson said schools across England would reopen in phases, with headteachers given as much notice as possible. The news comes as a new poll suggests that fewer than one in five of the British public believe the time is right to consider reopening schools, restaurants, pubs and stadiums. The prime minister’s former business adviser Andrew Griffith wrote in the Sunday Telegraph that \"every additional day the phone rings unanswered in ‘lockdown’ Britain is an order lost to an overseas competitor whose own economy is open for business\", as opposed to the world’s fifth largest economy.

        "news": "The British prime minister Boris Johnson has played down the prospect of a second national coronavirus lockdown, saying he did not want to use it any more than Britain’s Trident nuclear deterrent. Johnson said the authorities were getting better at identifying and isolating local outbreaks, although it was important that the power to order national action was held in reserve. \"I can’t abandon that tool any more than I would abandon a nuclear deterrent. But it is like a nuclear deterrent, I certainly don’t want to use it. And nor do I think we will be in that position again,\" he told the Sunday Telegraph. His comments could lead to further tensions between ministers and their scientific experts after the chief scientific adviser, Sir Patrick Vallance, warned on Friday there was \"a risk\" that national measures could be needed as winter approaches. Announcing another easing of lockdown restrictions in England, Johnson on Friday said he hoped there could be a \"significant return to normality\" in time for Christmas. At the same time, he said the government had given local authorities new powers to close specific premises, shut outdoor spaces and cancel events. Johnson told the Telegraph: \"It’s not just that we’re getting much better at spotting the disease and isolating it locally, but we understand far more which groups it affects, how it works, how it’s transmitted, so the possibility of different types of segmentation, of enhanced shielding for particular groups, is now there. \"We’re genuinely able now to look at what’s happening in much closer to real time, to isolate outbreaks and to address them on the spot, and to work with local authorities to contain the problem locally and regionally if we have to.\" As he approaches his first anniversary in office, Johnson insisted his agenda for domestic reform and \"levelling up\" the economy would not be blown off course by the pandemic. \"We want to be a transformative government, because there’s a massive opportunity in this country to do things differently and to do things better,\" he said. \"We’ve seen that really exemplified in what happened with coronavirus.\" The official coronavirus death toll in the UK stands currently at 45,053, the highest in Europe and the third highest worldwide. The Office for National Statistics has recorded 64,500 excess deaths in the country during the pandemic, suggesting the real number of fatalities is likely higher than the official tally.",

A cross-party group of senior MPs, scientists and trade unions said that holidaymakers already staying in a country that has been added to the quarantine list should be given statutory sick pay during their two-week isolation, in an effort to improve compliance and help those unable to work.

        "title": "Reopening schools 'a moral duty' – Johnson",
        "news": "Boris Johnson has insisted the nation has \"a moral duty\" to reopen schools next month, amid indications he would force pubs, restaurants and shops to close ahead of schools in the event of severe coronavirus flare-ups. Writing exclusively in the Mail on Sunday, Johnson said it the \"national priority\" to get all pupils back into classrooms in September after months without in-person education. \"This pandemic isn’t over, and the last thing any of us can afford to do is become complacent,\" he wrote. \"But now that we know enough to reopen schools to all pupils safely, we have a moral duty to do so.\" He warned of the \"spiralling economic costs\" of parents and carers being unable to work, adding: \"Keeping our schools closed a moment longer than absolutely necessary is socially intolerable, economically unsustainable and morally indefensible.\" MAIL EXCLUSIVE: ⁦@BorisJohnson⁩ : It’s a moral duty to reopen schools #TomorrowsPapersToday It comes after children’s commissioner for England Anne Longfield had said the reopening of schools \"should be prioritised\", insisting they must be first to reopen and last to close during any reintroduction of restrictions. However leading scientist and teachers unions have expressed concerns about the safety of the government’s plans to reopen schools. According to the PA news agency, Johnson is understood to favour only closing schools as the last resort after scientific advisers warned more restrictions may be needed to reopen classrooms in England next month. A No 10 source told PA on Saturday that Mr Johnson’s expectation is that schools would be the last sector to close, with firms being shut first in the event of severe local lockdowns. \"The PM has been clear that businesses including shops, pubs and restaurants should be forced to close first, with schools remaining open for as long as possible,\" the source said. But schools minister Nick Gibb said this week that the government cannot \"decree\" that classroom education would be prioritised, instead saying decisions would be made by local health chiefs. Professor Chris Whitty, the chief medical officer for England, has warned the nation has \"probably reached near the limit or the limits\" of what can be done to reopen society safely. And Professor Neil Ferguson, whose modelling led to the decision to impose the lockdown, suggested ministers would need to \"row back on the relaxation of restrictions\" to allow a full-time return to schools while keeping the virus under control.",

        "title": "UK government resumes easing of lockdown measures in England",
        "news": "The UK prime minister Boris Johnson confirmed plans to open up more of the economy from Saturday, including giving the go-ahead to delayed plans to resume socially distanced indoor performances and allowing beauty salons to offer more treatments in England. The moves were postponed from 1 August due to concerns about a slight increase in the number of people in England testing positive for Covid-19 but that now appears to have levelled off. From 15 August: The changes will not apply in the specific areas where local restrictions are in place. Johnson said: Most people in this country are following the rules and doing their bit to control the virus, but we must remain focused and we cannot be complacent. That is why we are strengthening the enforcement powers available to use against those who repeatedly flout the rules. At every stage I have said our plan to reopen society and the economy is conditional and that it relies on continued progress against the virus. Today, we are able to announce some further changes which will allow more people to return to work and the public to get back to more of the things they have missed. However, as I have always said, we will not hesitate to put on the brakes if required, or to continue to implement local measures to help to control the spread of the virus. New guidance will also mean that staff offering \"close contact\" services, including hairdressers, will now have to wear a face mask as well as a clear visor. The move, which follows new evidence from the scientific advisory group for emergencies (Sage) is aimed at protecting customers and staff from respiratory droplets caused by sneezing, coughing, or speaking. The guidance also applies to businesses that operate remotely, such as massage therapists working in people’s homes, and those learning in vocational training environments. More detail on the new enforcement measures will be set out in the coming week. The home secretary Priti Patel said she would not allow progress in tackling the virus to be undermined by \"a small minority of senseless individuals\". These measures send a clear message - if you don’t cooperate with the police and if you put our health at risk, action will follow.",

        "title": "Boris Johnson urges parents to send children back to school in September",
        "news": "Boris Johnson has issued a plea to parents to send their children back to the classroom when schools reopen next month. The UK prime minister said the risk of contracting coronavirus in schools is \"very small\", and that pupils face greater harm by continuing to stay away from the classroom. Many pupils in England have not been to class since March when schools were closed except to look after vulnerable children and those of keyworkers. Schools in Scotland reopened earlier this month, while those in England, Wales and Northern Ireland are expected to welcome all pupils from the beginning of September. Johnson said: \"I have previously spoken about the moral duty to reopen schools to all pupils safely, and I would like to thank the school staff who have spent the summer months making classrooms Covid-secure in preparation for a full return in September. \"We have always been guided by our scientific and medical experts, and we now know far more about coronavirus than we did earlier this year. \"As the Chief Medical Officer has said, the risk of contracting Covid-19 in school is very small and it is far more damaging for a child’s development and their health and wellbeing to be away from school any longer. \"This is why it’s vitally important that we get our children back into the classroom to learn and to be with their friends. Nothing will have a greater effect on the life chances of our children than returning to school.\" In response, Liberal Democrat education spokeswoman Layla Moran said: \"The government must rapidly upscale Test and Trace and ensure schools have the mental health support, financial resources and the use of community spaces they need ahead of opening fully. \"The country, and seemingly the prime minister, has lost faith in Gavin Williamson [the education secretary]. To restore confidence among parents, pupils and teachers the best thing the prime minister could do is sack him, rather than speak for him.\"",

        "title": "Gatherings of more than six people to be banned in England",
        "news": "Social gatherings of more than six people will be illegal in England from Monday as the government seeks to curb the rise in coronavirus cases. Prime minister Boris Johnson will use a press conference on Wednesday to announce the change in the law after the number of daily positive Covid-19 cases in the UK rose to almost 3,000. The legal limit on social gatherings will be reduced from 30 people to six. It will apply to gatherings indoors and outdoors – including private homes, as well as parks, pubs and restaurants. Gatherings of more than six people will be allowed where the household or support bubble is larger than six, or where the gathering is for work or education purposes. Exemptions will also apply for weddings, funerals and organised team sports in a Covid-secure way. Johnson is expected to tell the press conference: We need to act now to stop the virus spreading. So we are simplifying and strengthening the rules on social contact – making them easier to understand and for the police to enforce. It is absolutely critical that people now abide by these rules and remember the basics – washing your hands, covering your face, keeping space from others, and getting a test if you have symptoms. Downing Street said chief medical officer Prof Chris Whitty, chief scientific adviser Sir Patrick Vallance and the government had jointly agreed that urgent action was needed after the rise in coronavirus cases. Some 2,420 new lab-confirmed cases of coronavirus were recorded in Britain as of 9am on Tuesday, following the 2,988 reported in the UK on Sunday, which was the largest daily figure since May. The government hopes that the change to the law will make it easier for the police to identify and disperse illegal gatherings. Failure to comply could result in a £100 fine, which will double on each repeat offence up to £3,200. Number 10 said Johnson held a virtual roundtable with police forces last week where officers expressed their desire for rules on social contact to be simplified. The Police Federation of England and Wales urged the government to \"play its part\" through a public information campaign after \"so many changes in legislation\". The association’s national chairman John Apter said: With the increase in confirmed Covid cases, it’s no surprise the government has made this announcement. For policing, these constant changes to legislation are becoming the norm. The pressures on policing have increased significantly over recent months and this latest change will add to this pressure. My colleagues will support the public through what is going to be a very difficult time. At all times they will also remind people that a breach of these regulations means breaking the law. However, the government needs to play its part. With so many changes in legislation, an effective public information campaign must be a priority - as there’s been so much confusion for the public and many people don’t know exactly what the law says. We would urge the public to do the right thing and comply with the new rules, to help protect each other and prevent the further spread of this deadly virus.",

Police have also been handed powers to issue £1,000 fines and make arrests to enforce 2 metre social distancing in pubs and restaurants, the Guardian has learned. Boris Johnson is expected to make an address to the nation on Tuesday setting out the new measures. With cases doubling every week across the UK and a second wave expected to last up to six months, health officials had advised the government over the weekend to \"move hard and fast\", according to a source. Meanwhile, the Treasury was concerned that many businesses had \"no buffer\" to withstand a significant new economic hit. The UK’s Covid-19 alert level was raised to four on Monday, meaning the virus is \"high or rising exponentially\" – a move which gave Johnson cover for renewed action.",

Restrictions will be similar to those introduced at the start of the pandemic in March, however this time courts, schools, and universities will remain open.

All non-essential retail is to close, and the mixing of people inside homes will be forbidden, except for childcare reasons and other forms of vital support.

The new measures come as the Office for National Statistics estimates that 568,100 people in England were infected with coronavirus in the week to 23 October. UK chief scientific adviser Sir Patrick Vallance said deaths in England over the winter could be twice as high or more than during the first wave. The chief medical officer for England, Chris Whitty, said: \"We now have around 50,000 new cases a day, and that is rising. \"If we do nothing, the inevitable result will means these numbers will go up and they will eventually exceed the peak that we saw in spring of this year.\" \"I’m afraid no responsible prime minister can ignore the message of these figures,\" Johnson said. \"There is no alternative.\" Just at the end of July, Johnson had ruled out a second national lockdown.",

        "news": "Boris Johnson will face sustained pressure from within his own party not to extend England’s national lockdown next month after senior Tory backbenchers formed a group to resist any such move, PA reports. Some 32 Conservatives rebelled against the government when the Commons approved the second lockdown for England which lasts until 2 December. The prime minister said he expects the nation to return to a tiered local system by then and promised MPs a vote for the replacement to the four-week lockdown. Former chief whip Mark Harper and ex-Brexit minister Steve Baker will lead the \"Covid recovery group\" to resist any extension of the measure in the Commons vote. Harper said: The cure we’re prescribing runs the risk of being worse than the disease. The group outlined three guiding principles calling on ministers to undertake a cost-benefit analysis of restrictions, to end the \"monopoly\" of advice from UK government scientists and to improve measures to tackle Covid-19 such as test and trace. Baker said: We must find a more sustainable way of leading our lives until a vaccine is rolled out, rather than throwing our prosperity away by shutting down and destroying our economy, and overlooking the untold health consequences caused by lockdowns and restrictions. Sir Graham Brady, the influential chair of the 1922 committee of Conservative MPs, is among those said to have joined the group, along with the likes of William Wragg and Sir Robert Syms.",

        "news": "Oliver Milman, an environment reporter for Guardian in New York, has some analysis on the progression of the coronavirus pandemic in the US. A model relied upon by the White House, from the University of Washington, estimates that the virus will \"peter out\" in May and then essentially grind to a halt by the summer. This is based on the experiences of China and Italy, previous coronavirus hotspots. But this model, like all predictions, is dynamic and depends upon the application of measures such as social distancing to slow the rate of transmission. Other forecasts have been more pessimistic, warning that it will be difficult to tame the spread of the virus until well after summer. Premature relaxation of restrictions on gatherings of people could see a second, much more severe, increase in infections. The sheer size of the US, as well as its large population, means that there will be several ‘peaks’ at different times across the country. While the situation may be starting to stabilize somewhat in New York, areas in the heart of the country have yet to see the worst of the virus.\"That is going to be confusing for people,\" said Doug Burgum, governor of North Dakota. \"If wow, New York had all these deaths and they are opening up, why aren’t we opening? That will be a communication challenge for us, but we have to just keep monitoring and see where we are going on this.\"",

From the Associated Press: The warning comes as doctors at a New York hospital published a report that heart rhythm abnormalities developed in most of 84 coronavirus patients treated with hydroxychloroquine and the antibiotic azithromycin, a combo Trump has promoted. Both drugs are known to sometimes alter the heartbeat in dangerous ways, and their safety or ability to help people with COVID-19 is unknown. The warning excludes in hospital and research studies. A National Institutes of Health experts panel earlier this week also recommended against taking that drug combo except in a formal study.",

The syndrome has been largely undetected in the United States, according to the American Academy of Pediatrics.Gorelik said he believes the cases are likely not Kawasaki disease, but a similar process that shares an underlying mechanism with Kawasaki, which is thought to be triggered by an infectious agent that sparks an immune response.",

        "news": "Here is the full story on Twitter labelling Trump’s false claims with a warning for the first time. The Guardian’s Julia Carrie Wong reports from San Francisco with Sam Levine in New York: Twitter for the first time took action against a series of tweets by Donald Trump, labeling them with a warning sign and providing a link to further information. Since ascending to the US presidency, Trump has used his Twitter account to threaten a world leader with war, amplify racist misinformation by British hate figures and, as recently as Tuesday morning, spread a lie about the 2001 death of a congressional aide in order to smear a cable news pundit. Throughout it all, Twitter has remained steadfast in its refusal to censor the head of state, even going so far as to write a new policy to allow itself to leave up tweets by \"world leaders\" that violate its rules. The company’s decision on Tuesday afternoon to affix labels to a series of Trump tweets about California’s election planning is a result of a new policy debuted on 11 May. They were applied – hours after the tweets initially went out – because Trump’s tweets violated Twitter’s \"civic integrity policy\", a company spokeswoman confirmed, which bars users from \"manipulating or interfering in elections or other civic processes\", such as by posting misleading information that could dissuade people from participating in an election.",

        "news": "Florida has surpassed 500,000 coronavirus cases as testing ramps up following a temporary shutdown of some sites because of Tropical Storm Isaias. A long line of cars waited outside Hard Rock Stadium in Miami Gardens on Wednesday morning for a coronavirus testing site to reopen after being closed because of the storm. Florida reported 225 new deaths on Wednesday, bringing its seven-day average of daily reported deaths to a high of 185, behind Texas with 197. Florida’s rate is approaching a quarter of that seen in New York at its peak in mid-April. The number of people treated in hospitals statewide for the coronavirus continued a two-week decline, with 7,622 patients late Wednesday morning, a decrease of 175 from the previous day and down from highs of 9,500 two weeks ago. The Florida Department of Health reported 5,409 new coronavirus cases on Wednesday. Overall, Florida’s reported 502,739 cases ranks second to California, with more than 527,000 cases, and above Texas with more than 466,000, according to Johns Hopkins University. The Hard Rock site briefly shut down on Wednesday because of lightning in the area. Testing resumed once the weather cleared. Florida governor Ron DeSantis this week announced that quicker testing, with results in about 15 minutes, would be offered at the stadium and at Marlins Park. \"Obviously if you are somebody that is symptomatic and you don’t get your result back for seven days that is not helpful. For asymptomatic test takers, if it takes seven days then the test is basically useless at that time,\" DeSantis said.",

        "title": "Texas, Florida, California and New York among states not following new US Covid-19 testing plan",
        "news": "Several large US states including Texas are not heeding new federal health officials’ calls to reduce Covid-19 testing of some exposed to the virus, joining a broad rebuke of the Trump administration by public health leaders. Arizona, California, Connecticut, Florida, Illinois, Texas, New Jersey and New York all plan to continue to test asymptomatic people who have been exposed to Covid-19, despite new guidance from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) suggesting that such tests may not be needed. \"The current Texas guidance recommends testing for all close contacts of a confirmed case because it allows for early case identification among people who are at a higher risk of infection,\" a spokesman for the Texas Department of State Health Services in a statement. \"There’s not a planned change at this point.\" California and New York made similar statements. The Florida Department of Health said asymptomatic testing was continuing while the new CDC recommendations were evaluated, and Texas also said it would evaluate. The CDC said this week that people exposed to Covid-19 but not symptomatic may not need to be tested, shocking doctors and politicians, and prompting accusations the guidance was politically motivated. Even before the CDC guidance, coronavirus testing in the US had dropped. The US tested on average 675,000 people a day last week, down from a peak in late July of over 800,000 people a day. Nationally, cases have fallen for five weeks in a row but infections are surging again in the US Midwest with four states reporting record one-day increases in cases on Thursday as the US death toll climbed above 180,000. The CDC had previously recommended testing of all people who had close contact with someone who was diagnosed with Covid-19. New York governor Andrew Cuomo said the state of New York would not be abiding by the new guidance and challenged the assertion that politics played no role in the change. \"This 180-degree reversal of Covid-19 testing guidelines is reckless, and not based on science and has the potential to do long-term damage to the (CDC’s) reputation,\" Cuomo said in a joint statement, along with the governors of New Jersey and Connecticut, who also said their states would not be following the CDC’s guidance. Admiral Brett Giroir, the assistant secretary for health at the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), said there was no political pressure from the administration. He said that testing asymptomatic patients too early could produce false negatives and contribute to the virus’s spread. CNN and The New York Times reported on Wednesday that US public health officials were ordered by high-level members of the Trump administration to push forward with the changes. CDC director Robert Redfield issued a statement on Thursday that \"everyone who needs a Covid-19 test, can get a test,\" but \"everyone who wants a test does not necessarily need a test.\" Globally, many nations advocate early testing. The World Health Organization on Thursday said, that resources permitting, people exposed to the coronavirus should be tested even if they do not show immediate symptoms of infection. European governments have used broad testing and isolation to control the virus. France, for instance, recommends that anyone who thinks they need a test should get one and in Germany, people with close contact of 15 minutes or more with a person with Covid-19 are advised to have a test.",

        "news": "Florida has surpassed 500,000 coronavirus cases as testing ramps up following a temporary shutdown of some sites because of Tropical Storm Isaias. A long line of cars waited outside Hard Rock Stadium in Miami Gardens on Wednesday morning for a coronavirus testing site to reopen after being closed because of the storm. Florida reported 225 new deaths on Wednesday, bringing its seven-day average of daily reported deaths to a high of 185, behind Texas with 197. Florida’s rate is approaching a quarter of that seen in New York at its peak in mid-April. The number of people treated in hospitals statewide for the coronavirus continued a two-week decline, with 7,622 patients late Wednesday morning, a decrease of 175 from the previous day and down from highs of 9,500 two weeks ago. The Florida Department of Health reported 5,409 new coronavirus cases on Wednesday. Overall, Florida’s reported 502,739 cases ranks second to California, with more than 527,000 cases, and above Texas with more than 466,000, according to Johns Hopkins University. The Hard Rock site briefly shut down on Wednesday because of lightning in the area. Testing resumed once the weather cleared. Florida governor Ron DeSantis this week announced that quicker testing, with results in about 15 minutes, would be offered at the stadium and at Marlins Park. \"Obviously if you are somebody that is symptomatic and you don’t get your result back for seven days that is not helpful. For asymptomatic test takers, if it takes seven days then the test is basically useless at that time,\" DeSantis said.",

The man had not visited China but a Chinese work colleague who was in Germany last week had started to feel sick on the flight home on 23 January, said Andreas Zapf, the head of the Bavarian state office for health and food safety. He had attended a training session given by his Chinese colleague on 21 January at the office of a car parts supplier Webasto in Stockdorf in Bavaria and tested positive for the virus on Monday evening. Unlike the other patients, the 33-year-old had not recently travelled to China. He remains in hospital in an isolation ward, but Zapf said he \"was doing well\". The Chinese woman immediately sought medical attention on her return to China and was confirmed to have caught the virus, which has spread rapidly in recent weeks after first emerging in the city of Wuhan. The woman had recently returned from visiting her parents in the Wuhan region, Zapf said. In a statement, the Webasto company said it had halted all business travel to and from China \"for at least the next two weeks\". Health officials are checking 40 people that the two infected workers have been in contact with recently, including colleagues and family members.",

The number represents a sharp increase from 1.06 on Friday, and is based on RKI’s moving 4-day average data, which reflects infection rates one to two weeks ago.

        "news": "Turkey has rolled out new inspection and enforcement rules after coronavirus cases jumped above 1,000 for the first time in three weeks, in what the government called a grave rise during peak holiday season. Top doctors have warned about insufficient testing and urged a tougher message from Ankara, which lifted a partial lockdown in June and has since lobbied hard for countries to allow tourists to visit to help get the economy back on its feet. President Tayyip Erdoğan’s government had called 1,000 a critical threshold to reconsider rules. On Tuesday it adopted daily quarantine inspections, new tracing oversight in all cities and measures for weddings, funerals and other large gatherings, although it avoided broad curbs on economic activity. The interior ministry said the nationwide rules - including some fines for violations - were needed to sustain the fight against the pandemic that has killed 5,765 and infected 234,934 in Turkey. The central city of Kirikkale will pilot a new call centre that checks complaints about citizens ignoring face masks and other rules, and for a \"safe area\" rewards system for business that abide by them, the ministry said. The 1,083 new Covid-19 cases reflect a \"severe\" rise after a four-day holiday weekend, health minister Fahrettin Koca wrote on Twitter, urging Turks to avoid unnecessary contact so that their vacations do not have grave consequences. New cases had hovered just below 1,000 since 13 July.The government has not publicly disclosed the number of critical care or intubated patients since 29 July, raising questions among some experts even while more than 40,000 tests have been logged daily. Dr Bülent Yilmaz, general secretary of the Turkish Medical Association, said people at risk were missing out on tests. \"Most of the tests are done to those who need routine tests. It seems that those who are in real trouble and risk groups are not sufficiently tested,\" Yilmaz told Reuters. Turks ignoring social distancing on vacation was troubling, he added. The images from the beaches are grim, but you cannot really blame people. The government needs to show the situation is serious so that people can take it seriously, too. Germany, Turkey’s second biggest source of tourists, has lifted a travel warning on four Turkish seaside provinces with low infection rates to help revive tourism.",

It said the virus was especially active in and around Paris and Marseille, the country’s two biggest cities. Some medical experts are worried about the impact of Paris St Germain fans’ wild, mask-less celebrations on the Champs Elysees avenue in central Paris after their soccer club reached the Champions League final on Tuesday. Paris municipal officials are also concerned about large gatherings of fans expected on Sunday, when Paris St Germain will play the final either against Olympique Lyonnais, another French club, or Germany’s Bayern Munich. Despite the surge in infections, Macron told Paris Match magazine in an interview that \"local strategies\" were preferable to another national lockdown, which he said would cause considerable \"collateral damage\". The seven-day moving average of the case tally, which smooths out daily reporting irregularities, is now at 2,621, above the 2,500 threshold for the first time since 19 April, when France was enforcing one of Europe’s strictest lockdowns. The number of people in hospital fell again by 17 to 4,806 and those in intensive care slipped by six to 374, reflecting the preponderance of younger people among the new cases who are more likely to be asymptomatic or not to fall seriously ill. Both numbers had been on an uninterrupted downward trend since early April, but that trend has slowed in the past two weeks. The number of deaths increased by 17 to 30,468, following an increase of 22 on Tuesday and of 19 on Monday.",

        "news": "The Dutch prime minister Mark Rutte has ordered extra lockdown measures to slow the spread of the coronavirus in the Netherlands, and said the government is also considering curfews and school closures. The new measures, which include a ban on public meetings of more than two people not in the same family, were imposed amid signs the epidemic had reached a second peak. Rutte said in a televised press conference: The number of new cases is falling, but not quickly enough. The measures go into effect on Wednesday for two weeks. Rutte said other measures will remain in place through mid-December. Bars and restaurants in the Netherlands were closed except for takeaway and delivery in a partial lockdown on 13 October to slow a second wave of infections. Public gatherings were then limited to four people. Rutte on Tuesday said museums, theatres, cinemas, zoos and amusement parks will also have to close. The Netherlands joins the UK, France, Germany and several smaller European countries in restricting gatherings and people’s movements in recent weeks. On Tuesday the National Institute for Health reported 64,087 new cases over the past week, down from 67,542 the week before, the first time weekly numbers have declined since August. Hospitals are near capacity because of a surge in patients with Covid-19, numbers of which are continuing to climb, and the government is under pressure to ease the strain on the healthcare system.",

The tally of infections now stands at 1,284,408 cases, according to the latest data release, which removes double entries and adds some cases that were not initially diagnosed as Covid-19. On Tuesday, the ministry reported 1,259,366 cases. Unlike France, Germany and the UK, which have imposed nationwide lockdowns, Spain has adopted a regional response to tackling the pandemic, leading to a patchwork of different regulations. Murcia on Wednesday joined several other regions including Catalonia in shutting down bars and restaurants, while the northern region of Cantabria banned citizens from travelling across municipal borders. Health minister Salvador Illa told a news conference it would take two to three weeks for the latest regional restrictions to produce effect, but added that \"there is still margin to take additional measures, there are a great many steps we can still take\", without specifying.",

        "news": "Germany will extend its current coronavirus restrictions through to early January unless there is a dramatic drop in infections - something that is not expected, chancellor Angela Merkel said. Speaking after a meeting with the heads of Germany’s 16 states, Merkel said the measures introduced in early November, including limits on private gatherings and the closure of restaurants, leisure and cultural facilities, cannot be lifted given current infection rates. The curbs will be continued \"until 20 December first but we assume that ... due to the very high incidence of infection, restrictions will have to apply until the beginning of January unless we have an unexpected decrease,\" Merkel said. The agreement means continued closures for restaurants, bars, sporting facilities and cultural venues in Europe’s biggest economy, though schools and shops will remain open. From 1 December, private gatherings will be limited to five people from two households - down from 10 people currently, though children are exempted from the new rule. Trains will also expand their seating capacity, in order to better ensure distancing between passengers. Fireworks will be banned on certain public squares to prevent people from gathering in large groups on New Year’s Eve in particular. Germany will also seek a deal with European partners to close ski slopes through to early January, to prevent the virus spreading further. \"I will say this openly that it won’t be easy, but we will try,\" Merkel said. The measures were agreed after more than seven hours of tense talks, with some less-affected regions calling for lighter restrictions. The number of new infections in Germany has plateaued over the past two weeks, with October’s exponential growth brought to a halt. However, health officials have sounded the alarm over rapidly filling intensive care units and an inability to track the source of transmission while rates remain high. In order to ease restrictions, the infection rate would have to come down to below 50 new cases per 100,000 inhabitants per week, Merkel said - a far cry from the current seven-day incidence of almost 140. \"The steeply rising curve has become a flat one, but this is only a partial success. We can by no means be satisfied with this partial success,\" she said. Germany has registered a total of 961,320 coronavirus cases and 14,771 deaths, according to the Robert Koch Institute disease control centre. Wednesday saw 18,633 new cases and a record 410 deaths.",

So far, only retailers of essential goods, such as food, have been allowed to stay open. But the move to allow other shops to resume business mirrors similar easing measures in Germany, Luxembourg and the Netherlands. Bars, restaurants and cafes will remain closed and people will continue to be required to work from home where possible, limit social contacts. A curfew from midnight to 5am (2300-0400 GMT) will also remain in place. This year \"we will celebrate Christmas with our families, in small numbers. It will be more intimate,\" the prime minister said. There would also be no fireworks at New Year. We mustn’t spoil in four days what we’ve achieved in four weeks,\" De Croo said, but suggested a more general easing of restrictions might be possible from mid-January if infection numbers continue to come down. The premier also advised people not to travel to other countries with higher caseloads and said that border controls would be put in place and quarantine requirements imposed for travellers returning from virus hotspots. Belgium has recorded nearly 570,000 infections since the start of the pandemic, but recently appears to be getting the situation under control. An average 2,765 daily cases were registered last week, just a fifth of the number last month. Authorities hope to bring that cases down to around 500 per day by the end of the year.",

The measures, which had been due to expire on 20 December, include keeping restaurants and hotels shut and limiting private gatherings to five people from two households. \"The states will extend their measures from December 20 until January 10,\" Merkel told a news conference, adding that another round of consultations would be held on 4 January. \"In principle things will remain as they are.\" While the daily rise in infection numbers has started to fall, Germany reported its highest single-day death toll on Wednesday since the start of the pandemic, and regions that had been spared the worst are seeing case numbers surge. More than 17,000 new cases were reported overnight, and 487 deaths - a new daily record. Markus Soeder, leader of the southern state of Bavaria, said the high number of deaths justified keeping restrictions in place until January. He said: Over the next few weeks we will also be considering whether all this is enough. In the past, Germany’s many regional and central government bodies have been at odds over how strictly to impose lockdown, since cases were concentrated in the south and west of the country. While Merkel has always been in favour of stricter lockdowns, many of the regional premiers who have the final say in Germany’s federal system were opposed. This is beginning to change. Other than a few, mainly northern areas, the entire country is well above the rate of 50 new infections per 100,000 population per week that the government says is the fastest the virus can spread without overwhelming track-and-trace systems. Restrictions on gatherings will be eased slightly over Christmas to allow families to meet.",

        "news": "Germany will roll out the BioNTech/Pfizer vaccine against the coronavirus on 27 December with priority given to seniors in care homes, the Berlin city government said. The announcement came as Germany registered its highest daily death toll from Covid-19 and as it entered a strict lockdown in an attempt to bring down soaring infections. Along with other members of the EU, Germany has decided to wait for the European Medicines Agency (EMA) to approve the vaccine. It is expected to make an announcement on 21 December. A senior EU official said on Wednesday the bloc could give its final approval for the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine on 23 December. \"The federal states will start vaccination against the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 on 27 December,\" the local government that runs the German capital said in a statement after a conference between health minister Jens Spahn and health officials from Germany’s 16 states. Spahn has expressed frustration at the lack of approval of a vaccine partly developed in Germany even as countries such as Britain and the US are rolling it out. The number of registered Covid-19 deaths jumped by a record 952 on Wednesday. The previous record was 598 last Friday. However, Wednesday’s figures are not entirely comparable to previous days because they were inflated by a technical problem in one state, said the Robert Koch Institute for infectious diseases, which collates the data. Fears the pandemic is spiralling out of control prompted chancellor Angela Merkel and state governors to announce on Sunday a tough lockdown from 16 December until at least 10 January. Shops and schools will stay shut in a pre-Christmas tightening of restrictions following a partial lockdown in November, which closed bars and restaurants but failed to contain a second wave of the pandemic. Germany was more successful than many countries in keeping the coronavirus under control in the first wave in the spring but the situation looks different now. The Robert Koch Institute put the number of confirmed cases at 1,379,238, an increase of 27,728. The total death toll in Germany is 23,427. The seven-day incidence of cases ticked up to 180 per 100,000 people from 174 on Tuesday. • This entry was amended on 18 December 2020 to clarify that Germany has decided to wait for the EMA to approve the vaccine, rather than being obliged to do so as an earlier version indicated.",

        "news": "A drop in the number of new coronavirus cases for two days is good news, says the director general of the World Health Organization. However, he cautions against reading too much into it. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said the numbers could go up again, but the last two days were showing a declining trend. There were roughly 3,900 new cases reported worldwide on 5 February, 3,700 on 6 February and 3,200 on 7 February - the vast majority in China, WHO figures show. At the Science Media Centre, Paul Hunter, professor in Medicine at the University of East Anglia, said: Over the last two days we have actually seen the first of two consecutive declines in the number of new cases, which is nice, but whether that is sustainable or not we will only know in about a week or so. The infection, like most droplet-spread infections, tend to spread more in winter than in summer, so it’s quite plausible that even if the spread does continue, at least in the northern hemisphere we will see a decline during the summerThe big question then will be whether it reappears in November as we move into the traditional flu seasons where these sorts of viruses ... tend to predominate. Ghebreyesus also reported that in response to his appeal earlier this week for more countries to share information about the outbreaks in their countries, not all nations had provided the requested information. \"There are some countries who have yet to send detailed case reports to WHO,\" he said. \"We urge those member states to share that information immediately.\"",

        "news": "The test used to diagnose coronavirus is being rolled out to laboratories across the UK from Monday, increasing testing capacity to more than 1,000 people a day. Currently coronavirus is tested and diagnosed in one laboratory in London, but testing will be extended to 12 labs across the country over the coming weeks. At its laboratories in London, Public Health England (PHE) has the capacity to process samples from more than 100 people a day. Now, to ensure that the country is prepared for further cases and to speed up the time taken to get results, the test will be carried out by trained scientists across England, Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland. This will increase testing capacity to more than 1,000 people a day for England. Prof Yvonne Doyle, PHE’s medical director, said: Once China confirmed that they had identified a novel coronavirus, Public Health England was ready to test potential cases in this country. We have now trained scientists in labs across the UK to conduct the specialist test – ensuring that we are well prepared should we begin to see an increased number of cases across the country. The test, developed by PHE, made the UK one of the first countries outside China to have assured testing capability for the new coronavirus. When a clinician suspects coronavirus in a patient, they take samples from the nose, throat and deeper respiratory tract and send them for laboratory testing. Using the diagnostic test, scientists can look for evidence of the presence of any type of coronavirus and then hone in on specific genetic clues that identify the novel coronavirus associated with this outbreak. The UK-wide roll-out is the fastest deployment of a new test to PHE and NHS labs in recent history, including in the swine flu pandemic in 2009. In addition to processing samples from suspected cases in the UK, PHE is now working as a reference laboratory for WHO, testing samples from countries that do not have assured testing capabilities.",

He explained that while China reported an extra 13,332 clinically confirmed cases in Hubei province today, these \"relate to a period going back days and weeks\" and have been retrospectively classified based on diagnosis by medical professionals while awaiting laboratory test confirmation. We’re not dealing with a spike of cases of 14,000 in one day. This does not represent a significant change in the trajectory of the virus. It remains unclear whether the spike in deaths reported by China - an additional 254 fatalities - relate to these clinically confirmed cases or not. Ryan, the executive director of the WHO health emergencies programme, said that apart from the Diamond Princess cruise ship, which now has 218 confirmed cases, there has been no dramatic transmission outside China. \"The iceberg may not be that great, but that’s not a guarantee,\" he added. The rest of a special WHO team is expected to arrive in China over the coming weekend to investigative the epicentre of the coronavirus outbreak, he announced. When asked about the most urgent action need to tackle the epidemic, Ryan raised a few issues.

He added that it will take hundreds of millions of dollars of investment in multiple drug candidates to find a solution, and states are going to have to support the private sector in this endeavour.

Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, director general of WHO, said in a press conference today: This trend must be interpreted very cautiously. Trends can change as new populations are affected. It’s too early to tell if this reported decline will continue. Every scenario is still on the table. He added that the virus seems to be \"not as deadly as other coronavirus including Sars and Mers\", with the majority of patients making a full recovery. More than 80% of patients have mild disease and will recover. In about 14% of cases, the virus causes severe diseases including pneumonia and shortness of breath. And about 5% of patients have critical diseases including respiratory failure, septic shock and multi-organ failure. In 2% of reported cases, the virus is fatal, and the risk of death increases the older you are. We see relatively few cases among children. More research is needed to understand why.",

In some places, he said, that might occur as soon as May. But whenever restrictions ease, Fauci said, \"we know that there will be people who will be getting infected.\"Social distancing guidelines imposed by President Donald Trump are set to expire 30 April. Trump is eager to restart the economy, which has stalled because most Americans are under orders to stay at home to help slow the virus spread.

But US President Donald Trump, increasingly critical of China’s management of the first outbreak, claims to have proof it started in a Wuhan laboratory. And US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo on Sunday said \"enormous evidence\" backed up that claim, which China has vehemently denied. \"Like any evidence-based organisation, we would be very willing to receive any information that purports to the origin of the virus,\" Ryan said, stressing that this was \"a very important piece of public health information for future control. \"If that data and evidence is available, then it will be for the United States government to decide whether and when it can be shared, but it is difficult for the WHO to operate in an information vacuum in that regard,\" he added.",

        "news": "Brazil has drawn further criticism for its handling of the coronavirus pandemic after sharing contradictory figures on deaths and infections, intensifying a scandal over the country’s Covid-19 data. A senator called for a congressional inquiry and the discrepancy prompted criticism from across the political spectrum after initial health ministry data on Brazil’s number of cases and death toll was contradicted by numbers uploaded to the ministry’s online data portal. On Monday, the ministry said in a statement the discrepancy was predominantly due to mistakes in the numbers from two states that were later corrected. It explained that the later, lower daily death toll of 525 was the correct one. Senator Eliziane Gama, leader of centrist party Citizenship, asked the Senate to open an inquiry into the numbers, while the WHO stressed the importance of \"consistent and transparent\" communication from Brazil. It ranks second in confirmed cases, behind the United States, and its death toll last week surpassed Italy’s. The discrepancy followed recent decisions to remove from a national website a trove of data about the country’s outbreak, and to push back the daily release of new numbers late into the evening and after the country’s main television news program. Brazil could see Covid-19 deaths rise to 165,960 by August, above the forecast for the United States which has 100 million more people, according to a new projection by the University of Washington’s Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation.The updated forecast suggests Brazil’s epidemic could become the most lethal globally. For Carlos Machado, head of research at the National School of Public Health, part of the respected public institute Oswaldo Cruz Foundation, the lack of dependable data in Brazil is dangerous. \"Not having updated and reliable data during a pandemic of this proportion is like driving in the dark,\" he said. \"While we do not have a vaccine, information is the best weapon we have.\" \"By changing the numbers, the ministry of health covers the sun with a sieve,\" Rodrigo Maia, speaker of the lower house, said on Twitter. \"The credibility of the statistics needs to be urgently recovered. A ministry that manipulates numbers creates a parallel world in order not to face the reality of the facts.\" According to the council, Brazil had recorded 680,456 cases of Covid-19 and 36,151 deaths from the disease by the end of Sunday afternoon.",

The head of the WHO’s emergencies programme, Dr Mike Ryan, said the drug should only be used in the cases where it has been shown to help. It is exceptionally important in this case, that the drug is reserved for use in severely ill and critical patients who can benefit from this drug clearly.",

The suspension will cover H-1B visas for skilled workers, H-2B visas for seasonal guest workers and other visa types, with an exception for workers in the food service industry, a senior official from the Trump administration said on Monday. President Donald Trump will also block L-1 visas for workers being transferred within a company through the end of the year, the official said, adding that the move would open up 525,000 jobs. Trump had previously hinted that he might extend a 60-day hold on green cards for foreign workers that he ordered to protect American jobs during the coronavirus outbreak. Analysts predict the number of green cards issued annually will drop from about 1 million to 300,000. The US dollar weakened and higher-risk currencies including the Australian dollar jumped on Monday as investors focused on the prospect for an eventual economic recovery from the coronavirus pandemic, Reuters reports.

Sixty-one deaths were recorded in the past 24 hours, bringing the total number of Covid-19 deaths to 1,991. Despite the grim death toll, data shows that the mortality rate in South Africa is at 2%, while 52.6% of virus patients have recovered. The worst-hit area is Western Cape, the coastal province accounting for 1,458 of the country’s deaths and more than half of its infections. According to the World Health Organization, more than half of the continents infections are in South Africa. Nigeria and Ghana are next on the list, having recorded over 20,000 and 14,000 cases respectively. South Africa has struggled to set a strategy for dealing with the pandemic. Officials instituted a strict lockdown when the virus first hit in March but they backtracked as the rate of infections increased and opted to reopen most sectors of the economy. Despite an unprecedented $26 billion virus relief package and food parcels, many South Africans have struggled to get by. Under-fire president Cyril Ramaphosa has admitted difficulties in balancing public health with saving the nation’s economy, which was already in tatters before the virus. \"For a country such as ours, which was already facing an unemployment crisis and weak economic growth, difficult decisions and difficult days lie ahead,\" he said in his weekly letter to the public on Monday. \"We would urge that the difficult decisions to be taken are taken with care and with due regard to balancing the sustainability of companies and the livelihoods of workers.\" The main opposition Democratic Alliance leader John Steenhuisen has threatened legal action if the government refuses to completely end the nationwide lockdown.",

The US president Donald Trump had to give one year’s notice of for withdrawal from the Geneva-based UN agency under a 1948 joint resolution of the US Congress, which also obliges Washington to pay financial support. The United States currently owes the WHO more than $200m (approximately £160m) in assessed contributions, according to the WHO website. After more than 70 years of membership, the United States moved to quit the WHO after Trump accused it of becoming a puppet of China amid the pandemic. The virus first emerged in China’s Wuhan city late last year. Stéphane Dujarric, a UN spokesman, said: The secretary general ... is in the process of verifying with the World Health Organization whether all the conditions for such withdrawal are met. Trump had halted US funding for the 194-member organisation in April, then demanded a series of reforms on 18 May, before announcing the decision to pull the US out less than two weeks later. The WHO is an independent international body that works with the United Nations. The UN sSecretary general António Guterres has said the WHO is \"absolutely critical to the world’s efforts to win the war against Covid-19\". Trump has long scorned multilateralism as he focuses on an \"America First\" agenda. Since taking office, he has quit the UN Human Rights Council, the UN cultural agency, a global accord to tackle climate change and the Iran nuclear deal. He has also cut funding for the UN population fund and the UN agency that aids Palestinian refugees.",

        "title": "Africa passes one million confirmed virus cases",
        "news": "Africa’s confirmed coronavirus cases have surpassed one million, but global health experts say the true toll is likely several times higher, reflecting the gaping lack of testing for the continent’s 1.3 billion people. While experts say infection tolls in richer nations can be significant undercounts, large numbers of undetected cases are a greater danger for Africa, with many of the world’s weakest health systems. The World Health Organization calls the milestone a pivotal point for Africa as infections in several countries are surging. The virus has spread beyond major cities into distant hinterlands where few health resources exist and reaching care could take days. African nations banded together early in the pandemic to pursue badly needed testing and medical supplies and advocate for equitable access to any successful vaccine. Swift border closures delayed the virus spread. But Africa’s most developed country, South Africa, has strained to cope as hospital beds fill up and confirmed cases are over a half-million, ranking fifth in the world. The country has Africa’s most extensive testing and data collection, and yet a South African Medical Research Council report last week showed many Covid-19 deaths were going uncounted. Other deaths were attributed to other diseases as people avoid health centres and resources are diverted to the pandemic. The WHO’s Africa chief, Matshidiso Moeti, said: It’s all a warning for Africa’s other 53 countries of what might lie ahead. While dire early predictions for the pandemic have not played out, we think its going to be here at a slow burn. Just two African countries at the start of the pandemic were equipped to test for the virus. Now virtually all have basic capacity, but supplies are often scarce. Some countries have a single testing machine. Some conduct fewer than 500 tests per million people, while richer countries overseas conduct hundreds of thousands. Samples can take days to reach labs. Even in South Africa, turnaround times for many test results have been a week or longer. \"We are fighting this disease in the dark,\" International Rescue Committee expert Stacey Mearns said. In addition, Africa has just 1,500 epidemiologists, a deficit of about 4,500. African nations overall have conducted just 8.8 million tests since the pandemic began, well below the Africa Centers for Disease Control and Preventions goal of 13 million per month. Africa CDC director John Nkengasong said estimating the true number of cases on the continent is very tricky. Some 70% of infections are asymptomatic, he said. But some experts are making their best guesses. Africa likely has at least 5 million infections, said Ridhwaan Suliman, a senior researcher at South Africa’s Council for Scientific and Industrial Research. He believes the true number in South Africa alone is at least 3 million. The country has conducted far more tests than any other in Africa, more than 3 million, but in recent days about 25% have come back positive. Because of shortages, South Africa largely limits testing to health workers and those showing symptoms.Experts see South Africa as an indication of whats to come elsewhere. Sema Sgaier, an assistant professor of global health at Harvard and director of the Surgo Foundation, thinks the number of infections across Africa could be more than 9 million. The US-based Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation puts the number at more than 8 million. And Resolve to Save Lives, led by Tom Frieden, former director of the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, estimates it could be 14 million.",

The country’s totals now stand at 7,121 cases and 87 deaths since February, according to health ministry data. Even before the blast there had been a recent surge in infections. The 4 August explosion killed at least 171 people, injured about 6,000 and damaged swathes of the capital, leaving around 300,000 people without habitable housing. Hospitals, many of which were damaged and their staff injured, were overwhelmed with wounded people. The World Health Organization spokesman Tarik Jarasevic told a United Nations briefing in Geneva on Tuesday that the displacement of so many people risked accelerating the spread of Covid-19. The WHO on 7 August issued an appeal for $15m to cover emergency health needs in Lebanon, where the healthcare sector was already under strain owing to shortages of medical supplies and medicine caused by a deep financial crisis. \"The emergency in Beirut has caused many Covid-19 precautionary measures to be relaxed, raising the prospects of even higher transmission rates and a large caseload in coming weeks,\" the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs said in a report on 10 August. It said at least 15 medical facilities, including three major hospitals, sustained partial or heavy structural damage from the blast. An assessment of 55 primary healthcare centres in Beirut showed only 47% could still provide full routine services.",

And the best way to do that is to vaccinate some people in all countries rather than all people in some countries,\" he said. \"Let me be clear: vaccine nationalism will prolong the pandemic, not shorten it.\" Scientists around the world are racing to develop a vaccine against Covid-19, which has killed over 1.1 million people globally. Several dozen vaccine candidates are currently being tested in clinical trials, ten of which are in the most advanced \"phase 3\" stage involving tens of thousands of volunteers, AFP reports. The European Union, the US, Britain, Japan and a slew of other nations have already placed large orders with the companies involved in developing the most promising vaccines.

The weekly US increase was 14%. Europe accounted for the highest number of new deaths, over 36,000, which was nearly half of the weekly global total.

        "news": "The World Health Organization has listed the Covid-19 vaccine from Pfizer and BioNTech for emergency use, saying the move opens the door for countries to expedite their own approvals to import and give the shot. Dr Mariangela Simao, WHO assistant director general for Access to Medicines and Health Products, said: This is a very positive step towards ensuring global access to Covid-19 vaccines. But I want to emphasise the need for an even greater global effort to achieve enough vaccine supply to meet the needs of priority populations everywhere. The Pfizer/BioNTech #COVID19 vaccine today became the first vaccine to receive WHO validation for emergency use since the outbreak began.Equitable global access to vaccines is crucial to combat the pandemic.👉  The WHO, together with the GAVI Vaccine Alliance and the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI), are spearheading a global effort called COVAX to distribute vaccines to low- and middle-income countries, to help make sure that shots do not go only to wealthy nations. The COVAX alliance has said it has agreements for nearly 2bn doses, with first deliveries due in early 2021. The alliance has said it has been in talks with Pfizer and BioNTech to secure its vaccine. Pfizer/BioNTech’s messenger RNA vaccine was 95% effective at preventing disease symptoms after two doses 21 days apart. Delivery is challenging, since it needs to be stored at -70C. The vaccine has previously been approved for emergency use in the US and Britain, and has conditional marketing approval in the EU and Switzerland, among other countries, where distribution of shots concentrating on older people and healthcare workers began in December.",

        "news": "Cancer patients with Covid-19 treated with a drug combination promoted by US President Donald Trump to counter coronavirus were three times more likely to die within 30 days than those who got either drug alone, U.S. researchers said. The preliminary results suggest doctors may want to refrain from prescribing the decades-old malaria treatment hydroxychloroquine with the antibiotic azithromycin for these patients until more study is done, researchers said. \"Treatment with hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin were strongly associated with increased risk of death,\" Dr. Howard Burris, president of the American Society of Clinical Oncology(ASCO), said in a briefing with reporters on the results. The drug combination initially was thought to help Covid-19 patients, but recent data has cast doubt. The preliminary findings, to be presented this week at ASCO’s virtual scientific meeting, show that the combination may pose a significant risk to cancer patients. \"Taking the combination gives a three times increased risk of dying within 30 days of any cause,\" Dr. Jeremy Warner of Vanderbilt University Medical System told reporters. Trump, who has often promoted hydroxychloroquine, in a March 21 tweet called the combination potentially \"one of the biggest game changers in the history of medicine.\" That was based on a study of fewer than 40 patients in the International Journal of Antimicrobial Agents. More recent studies have shown little or no benefit and increased risks. Warner and colleagues analysed data on 925 patients with cancer who became infected with the coronavirus between March and April. Thirteen percent of the patients died within 30 days of their diagnosis. Overall, patients whose cancers were actively progressing at the time of infection were five times more likely to die within 30 days than those who were in remission or had no current evidence of cancer. In the trial, 180 patients were taking hydroxychloroquine in combination with azithromycin, and 90 were taking hydroxychloroquine alone. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has allowed healthcare providers to prescribe the drugs for Covid-19 through an emergency-use authorisation, but has not approved the treatment. The governments of France, Italy and Belgium moved on Wednesday to halt the use of hydroxychloroquine for Covid-19 patients following a World Health Organization decision on Monday to pause a large trial of the drug due to safety concerns.",

        "news": "The World Health Organization has recommended that children over 12 should wear masks in the same contexts as adults in the bid to rein in the Covid-19 pandemic. The UN health agency, in cooperation with UNICEF, published fresh guidance on Friday on when it is appropriate for children to wear masks to impede the spread of the coronavirus crisis. The two UN agencies had convened a group of experts to review the limited data available on children’s contribution to the spread of COVID-19, as well as on the benefits of mask-wearing by children. Based on those findings, as well as considerations surrounding children’s developmental needs, they said the advice varied in different age groups. WHO thus recommends that \"children aged 12 and over should wear a mask under the same conditions as adults, in particular when they cannot guarantee at least a one-metre distance from others and there is widespread transmission in the area.\" The document acknowledged that much remains unknown about to what degree children contribute to the spread of the novel coronavirus. But it said that while there is some limited evidence that young children may have lower susceptibility to infection compared to adults, data indicated that teenagers \"may play a more active role in transmission than younger children\". The UN agencies said that children under five should not wear a mask. It comes after France’s education minister, Jean-Michel Blanquer, said schools will reopen on 1 September as normal, but all staff as well as pupils over the age of 11 must wear masks.",

Coronavirus cases in Colombia’s border area with Venezuela have increased ten-fold in the last two weeks, Etienne said in a virtual briefing from Washington with other Pan American Health Organization directors. Death rates are climbing in parts of Mexico, and similar trends are seen in Ecuador, Costa Rica and Bolivia, with similar patterns also emerging in areas of Argentina, she warned. Although the entire world is racing to develop new tools to prevent and cure Covid-19, a safe and effective vaccine that can be manufactured and delivered at scale is not around the corner. We must be clear that opening up too early gives this virus more room to spread and puts our populations at greater risk. Look no further than Europe. Etienne said governments must monitor travel very carefully because reopening to tourism can lead to setbacks. That has happened in the Caribbean, where several countries that had virtually no cases have experienced spikes as tourism resumed. According to a Reuters tally, Latin America has recorded around 8.4 million coronavirus cases, and over 314,000 deaths, both figures being the highest of any region.",

Hamas authorities urged Gazans to abide by the immediate shutdown, which includes the closure of workplaces, schools and mosques. Gaza has been under a crippling Israeli blockade since 2007 and access to the enclave was further restricted following the onset of the coronavirus pandemic. Those granted permission to enter the strip have been held in special quarantine centres for three weeks. There have been 109 coronavirus infections registered among those quarantined, with one death, according to the latest figures from the World Health Organization. The arrival of coronavirus among the broader population in Gaza, a densely-populated area home to two million Palestinians, has been feared for months. Suhair Zakkout, a spokeswoman for the ICRC in Gaza, said a coronavirus outbreak would be \"catastrophic\". \"The health system is already weakened by the restriction of movement, lack of financial resources, and the Palestinian internal differences,\" she told the Guardian. Gaza is currently facing severe power shortages after Israel cut off fuel supplies in response to incendiary balloons being flown across the frontier, which have set farmland ablaze. Rockets have also been fired from the enclave this month and the Israeli army has repeatedly struck Hamas targets, sparking concerns of a military escalation.",

        "news": "Several large US states including Texas are not heeding new federal health officials’ calls to reduce Covid-19 testing of some exposed to the virus, joining a broad rebuke of the Trump administration by public health leaders. Arizona, California, Connecticut, Florida, Illinois, Texas, New Jersey and New York all plan to continue to test asymptomatic people who have been exposed to Covid-19, despite new guidance from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) suggesting that such tests may not be needed. \"The current Texas guidance recommends testing for all close contacts of a confirmed case because it allows for early case identification among people who are at a higher risk of infection,\" a spokesman for the Texas Department of State Health Services in a statement. \"There’s not a planned change at this point.\" California and New York made similar statements. The Florida Department of Health said asymptomatic testing was continuing while the new CDC recommendations were evaluated, and Texas also said it would evaluate. The CDC said this week that people exposed to Covid-19 but not symptomatic may not need to be tested, shocking doctors and politicians, and prompting accusations the guidance was politically motivated. Even before the CDC guidance, coronavirus testing in the US had dropped. The US tested on average 675,000 people a day last week, down from a peak in late July of over 800,000 people a day. Nationally, cases have fallen for five weeks in a row but infections are surging again in the US Midwest with four states reporting record one-day increases in cases on Thursday as the US death toll climbed above 180,000. The CDC had previously recommended testing of all people who had close contact with someone who was diagnosed with Covid-19. New York governor Andrew Cuomo said the state of New York would not be abiding by the new guidance and challenged the assertion that politics played no role in the change. \"This 180-degree reversal of Covid-19 testing guidelines is reckless, and not based on science and has the potential to do long-term damage to the (CDC’s) reputation,\" Cuomo said in a joint statement, along with the governors of New Jersey and Connecticut, who also said their states would not be following the CDC’s guidance. Admiral Brett Giroir, the assistant secretary for health at the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), said there was no political pressure from the administration. He said that testing asymptomatic patients too early could produce false negatives and contribute to the virus’s spread. CNN and The New York Times reported on Wednesday that US public health officials were ordered by high-level members of the Trump administration to push forward with the changes. CDC director Robert Redfield issued a statement on Thursday that \"everyone who needs a Covid-19 test, can get a test,\" but \"everyone who wants a test does not necessarily need a test.\" Globally, many nations advocate early testing. The World Health Organization on Thursday said, that resources permitting, people exposed to the coronavirus should be tested even if they do not show immediate symptoms of infection. European governments have used broad testing and isolation to control the virus. France, for instance, recommends that anyone who thinks they need a test should get one and in Germany, people with close contact of 15 minutes or more with a person with Covid-19 are advised to have a test.",

Morrison’s pre-recorded speech on the virtual stage on Saturday morning to the 75th United Nations general assembly, praised the World Health Organization for establishing an inquiry into the global response to coronavirus, AAP reports. \"There is also a clear mandate to identify the zoonotic source of the Covid-19 virus and how it was transmitted to humans,\" he said. \"This virus has inflicted a calamity on our world and its peoples. We must do all we can to understand what happened for no other purpose than to prevent it from happening again.\" The inquiry resolution backed by 145 countries in May does not mention China, instead committing to an impartial, independent and comprehensive evaluation. China eventually supported the European Union motion. Ties between the two nations have since been fraught, with tariffs being imposed on some goods and Australian journalists being evacuated from China. Morrison urged other leaders to share a coronavirus vaccine if they discover one. He has previously said if Australia found a vaccine, it would be shared across the world. \"This is a global responsibility and it’s a moral responsibility for a vaccine to be shared far and wide,\" he said. \"Some might see short-term advantage or even profit.

Health Minister Pilar Mazzetti said this week that she expects vaccines to arrive in Peru in the first quarter of 2021 before general elections on April 11, and vaccines will likely be administered in voting centers. China’s Sinopharm and the United States’ Johnson &amp; Johnson are conducting trials of their vaccines in the country, potentially allowing Peru to buy doses at a discount, the ministry of health said. Peru has seen 111.55 deaths per 100,000 of its population, ranking third in the world for per capita mortality, according to a Reuters tally.",

        "news": "Nearly one in four people may not get Covid-19 vaccines until at least 2022 because rich countries with less than 15% of the global population have reserved 51% of the doses of the most promising vaccines, researchers said. Low- and middle-income countries - home to more than 85% of the world’s population - would have to share the remainder, said researchers from the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health in the US. An effective response to the pandemic requires high-income countries \"to share in an equitable distribution of Covid-19 vaccines across the world\", they wrote. \"The uncertainty over global access to Covid-19 vaccines traces not only to ongoing clinical testing, but also from the failure of governments and vaccine manufacturers to be more transparent and accountable over these arrangements,\" they added. As of 15 November, high-income nations had pre-ordered nearly 7.5bn doses of vaccines from 13 manufacturers, the paper said. This included Japan, Australia and Canada who collectively have more than 1bn doses but accounted for less than 1% of current Covid-19 cases, it said. Even if leading manufacturers’ vaccines reach their projected maximum production capacity, nearly 25% of the world’s population may not get the vaccines for another year or more, according to the paper. The People’s Vaccine Alliance coalition last week said pharmaceutical companies should openly share their technology and intellectual property through the World Health Organization so that more doses can be manufactured. The John Hopkins researchers said WHO’s COVAX Facility could play a key role in ensuring fairer access to approved vaccines but it has only secured 500m doses, far below its target of delivering at least 2bn doses by the end of 2021. Launched in April, the global pact aims to pool funds from wealthier countries and nonprofits to accelerate the development and manufacture of Covid-19 vaccines and distribute them equitably around the world. It has so far secured half of the funding it needs and the US and Russia - key players in vaccine development and manufacture - have not joined, the Johns Hopkins study said.",

        "news": "Colombia’s daily confirmed cases of coronavirus reached their highest level since mid-August on Thursday, as the government warned people against large holiday gatherings. The Andean country, which has had a total of 1,468,795 confirmed cases and 39,787 deaths, recorded 12,196 new cases on Thursday. The figure was the highest since 19 August, when there were 13,055 new cases. President Iván Duque and health officials have repeatedly warned Colombians against gathering in crowds at shopping areas and urged them to keep family celebrations limited in order to reduce spread of the virus. Duque on Wednesday said rising cases numbers could be traced to celebrations to mark the feast of the Immaculate Conception - known locally as Night of the Candles - when families gather to put candles in their windows or outside their homes. The daily death toll also rose past 200 on Wednesday and Thursday, reaching 204 and 227 respectively. Daily new recorded deaths have not surpassed 200 since September. Colombia expects to vaccinate about 15 million people against Covid-19 in 2021, including health care workers, those over 60 and those with pre-existing conditions. Intensive care units in Bogotá, a centre for infection, were at 74% capacity on Thursday, according to local health department figures. Brazil and Colombia are reporting the highest number of new cases in South America, the World Health Organization said this week.",

        "news": "The US senator Chuck Grassley will skip Donald Trump’s presidential nomination at the Republican National Convention in August due to coronavirus concerns, a spokesman for the senator has confirmed. Reuters has reported that the 86-year-old Iowa Republican has attended each of his party’s conventions since he was first elected to the Senate in 1980. His decision not to travel to Florida for this year’s event underscores broader concerns about holding mass gatherings as coronavirus cases there surge. \"I’m not going to go because of the virus situation,\" Grassley told reporters on Monday, according to a report in the Des Moines Register. The bulk of the Republican convention was moved from North Carolina after the state’s Democratic governor Roy Cooper would not commit to allowing a full convention because of pandemic concerns. Some 330 delegates will travel to Charlotte, North Carolina, from 22 to 24 August to nominate Trump as the Republican candidate to take on Democrat Joe Biden in the 3 November election. The more than 2,000 remaining delegates will perform a ceremonial vote between 24 and 27 August in Jacksonville, in Florida, to confirm the nomination, according to the Republican National Committee. The decision to relocate to Florida was made prior to the state’s recent spike in cases, which have grown from 667 new cases on 1 June to more than 10,000 new cases on Monday. The state has seen more than 200,000 total infections and 3,730 deaths as of Monday. The RNC plans to make testing available to all attendees but is discussing whether to make the testing mandatory.",

Biden told reporters on Saturday in Wilmington that he was not tested earlier in the day but would be tested Sunday morning. His campaign said he tested negative for Covid twice on Friday. Bates said in the statement that Biden was not in close contact with Trump, his family members or his aides during their debate Tuesday night. Several people in Trump’s orbit have tested positive in recent days. Biden’s campaign also emphasised in its latest statement that for months Biden and his campaign have followed public health guidelines on wearing masks and social distancing.

Covid-19 deaths reached 3,253 on Wednesday, pushing up the US total since the start of the pandemic to 289,740. A record 106,219 people were hospitalised with the highly infectious disease, threatening to overwhelm many healthcare systems. Healthcare professionals and support staff, exhausted by demands of the pandemic, have been watching patients die alone as millions of Americans refuse to follow medical advice to wear masks and avoid crowds and smaller gatherings to contain the virus’ spread. In California’s San Joaquin Valley agricultural region, less than 2% of intensive care unit (ICU) beds remain unoccupied, the California Department of Public Health said on Thursday. The number of available ICU beds continued to drop throughout the most populous U.S. state, with just 7.7% availability in the heavily populated southern California region.Nursing home residents and staff have also felt the burden. \"This is a pandemic that no one has ever experienced in our lifetimes,\" Stephen Hanse, president of the New York State Health Facilities Association and the New York State Center for Assisted Living, told Reuters on Thursday. The one-day death toll exceeded the number of lives lost on 9/11, underscoring the human toll and the call for Americans to redouble efforts. \"No Christmas parties. There is not a safe Christmas party in this country right now,\" Dr. Michael Osterholm, a member of president-elect Joe Biden’s Covid-19 advisory board, told CNN on Thursday. It won’t end after that, but that is the period right now where we could have a surge upon a surge upon a surge. More than half of US states have recently introduced or resumed restrictions to try to curtail the rampant spread of the virus. On Thursday, Virginia’s governor Ralph Northam imposed a midnight-to-5 am curfew among other measures that will kick in on Monday and last through at least 31 January. \"Case numbers have been rising for weeks, they’re higher now than they’ve ever been during this entire pandemic, Northam told a news briefing. Providing a ray of hope, a vaccine could start reaching healthcare workers, first responders and nursing home residents within days in what Hanse called \"light at the end of the tunnel.\" A panel of independent medical experts was due to decide later on Thursday whether to recommend that the US Food and Drug Administration authorise emergency use of a vaccine from Pfizer Inc and German partner BioNTech SE. FDA consent could come as early as Friday or Saturday, followed by the first US injections on Sunday or Monday, Moncef Slaoui, chief adviser to the Trump administration’s Operation Warp Speed vaccine development program, told Fox News. A second vaccine developed by Moderna Inc will be reviewed by the advisory panel next week. Biden, who succeeds Donald Trump on 20 January, has set a goal of vaccinating 100 million people within the first 100 days of his administration.",

The injections came the same day that a second vaccine, produced by Moderna, will start arriving in states. \"I’m ready,\" said Biden, who was administered the dose at a hospital in Newark, Delaware, and declined the option to count to three before the needle was inserted into his left arm. I’m doing this to demonstrate that people should be prepared when it’s available to take the vaccine. There’s nothing to worry about. Other top government officials last week joined the first wave of Americans to be inoculated against Covid-19 as part of the largest largest vaccination campaign in the nation’s history. The vice president Mike Pence, the house speaker Nancy Pelosi, the Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell and other lawmakers were given doses on Friday.

Russia imposed a \"non-working\" period across the country at the end of April which \"served as the decisive factor in lowering industrial output,\" Rosstat said in a statement, AFP reports. Industries were delivered a double blow as president Vladimir Putin ordered companies to stop work activities but continue paying salaries.

The automotive sector was the worst-hit, plummeting by 79.2 percent, while the pharmaceutical industries showed growth of 13.5 percent year on year.

The video of a ministers’ meeting surfaced in an investigation of whether the president, Jair Bolsonaro, interfered in appointing leaders of the federal police for personal gain. During the meeting, other ministers spoke, including Salles, with environmental groups saying his remarks prove that the Bolsonaro government is systematically seeking to dismantle environmental protections. \"We need to make an effort while we are in this calm moment in terms of press coverage, because they are only talking about Covid, and push through and change all the rules and simplify norms,\" Salles said in the video.

Russia is the third worst-affected country, with 423,186 confirmed cases. The UK is fourth, with 277,738. However, testing for the virus is not widespread even in many of the world’s richest countries, meaning that the true extent of the outbreak is likely to be much larger.",

Kim declared a state of emergency and imposed a lockdown on the border city of Kaesong, calling it a \"critical situation in which the vicious virus could be said to have entered the country,\" state news agency KCNA reported. If confirmed, it would be the first case officially acknowledged by North Korean authorities, who have so far said the country has no confirmed cases of the new coronavirus. According to KCNA, a person who defected to South Korea three years ago returned across the fortified border that divides the two Koreas with symptoms that suggested Covid-19. \"An emergency event happened in Kaesong City where a runaway who went to the south three years ago, a person who is suspected to have been infected with the vicious virus returned on 19 July after illegally crossing the demarcation line,\" KCNA said. KCNA did not specifically mention whether the individual had been tested, but said an \"uncertain result was made from several medical check-ups of the secretion of that person’s upper respiratory organ and blood,\" prompting officials to quarantine the person and investigate anyone he may have been in contact with. North Korea has received thousands of coronavirus testing kits from Russia and other countries, and imposed strict border closures. Thousands of people in North Korea were quarantined, but restrictions had recently eased.",

        "news": "Global coronavirus cases rose by more than 400,000 for the first time late on Friday, a record one-day increase as much of Europe enacts new restrictions to curb the outbreak. Europe, which successfully damped down the first surge of infections, has emerged as the new coronavirus epicentre in recent weeks and is reporting on average 140,000 cases a day over the past week. As a region, Europe is reporting more daily cases than India, Brazil and the US combined. Of every 100 infections reported around the world, 34 were from European countries, according to a Reuters analysis. The region is currently reporting a million new infections about every nine days and has reported more than 6.3 million cases since the pandemic began. Major European countries - the UK, France, Russia, the Netherlands and Spain - accounted for about half of Europe’s new cases in the week to 18 October. France is reporting the highest seven-day average of new cases in Europe with 19,425 infections per day followed by the United Kingdom, Russia, Spain and the Netherlands in the list of worst affected European countries. Several European countries are closing schools, cancelling elective surgeries and enlisting student medics as the authorities face a Covid-19 resurgence. Russia is moving students to online learning and Northern Ireland is closing schools for two weeks and restaurants for four. In Spain, authorities in Catalonia ordered bars and restaurants to close for 15 days and limited the numbers of people allowed in shops. The Czech Republic has also shifted schools to distance learning and plans to call up thousands of medical students. Hospitals are cutting non-urgent medical procedures to free up beds. Polish health officials have warned the country is on the brink of a disaster as a record 6,526 new coronavirus infections and 116 deaths were reported this week. Poland is ramping up training for nurses and considering creating military field hospitals. Latin America is the worst-affected region with about 27% of total Covid-19 cases followed by Asia, North America and Europe. India is reporting fewer cases this month compared with September, with 69,000 cases per day. The numbers have fallen by more than 20,400 over the last three weeks, down 22% from its previous peak. India reported 55,342 cases on 13 October, its lowest daily increase since 18 August. In the US, which has the largest total number of cases and deaths in the world, new infections are edging higher along with the most hospitalised Covid-19 patients since early September.",

Castex said that one in four deaths in the country were due to the virus and that while the R number was now below 1, it was too early to contemplate relaxing measures. He told a news conference: It would be irresponsible to soften the lockdown now. The gains (we are seeing) are fragile. The prime minister said that if the slowdown in the rate of new cases was maintained, France would pass the peak of the second wave early next week. But he said he would not hesitate to impose stricter measures if the spread of infections quickened once more. The virus has killed more than 42,000 people in France. Health authorities reported 35,879 new cases on Wednesday, taking the total to 1.86 million, overtaking Russia and making France the worst-affected country in the European region. \"The pressure on our hospitals has intensified enormously,\" the French prime minister said.

        "news": "Nearly one in four people may not get Covid-19 vaccines until at least 2022 because rich countries with less than 15% of the global population have reserved 51% of the doses of the most promising vaccines, researchers said. Low- and middle-income countries - home to more than 85% of the world’s population - would have to share the remainder, said researchers from the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health in the US. An effective response to the pandemic requires high-income countries \"to share in an equitable distribution of Covid-19 vaccines across the world\", they wrote. \"The uncertainty over global access to Covid-19 vaccines traces not only to ongoing clinical testing, but also from the failure of governments and vaccine manufacturers to be more transparent and accountable over these arrangements,\" they added. As of 15 November, high-income nations had pre-ordered nearly 7.5bn doses of vaccines from 13 manufacturers, the paper said. This included Japan, Australia and Canada who collectively have more than 1bn doses but accounted for less than 1% of current Covid-19 cases, it said. Even if leading manufacturers’ vaccines reach their projected maximum production capacity, nearly 25% of the world’s population may not get the vaccines for another year or more, according to the paper. The People’s Vaccine Alliance coalition last week said pharmaceutical companies should openly share their technology and intellectual property through the World Health Organization so that more doses can be manufactured. The John Hopkins researchers said WHO’s COVAX Facility could play a key role in ensuring fairer access to approved vaccines but it has only secured 500m doses, far below its target of delivering at least 2bn doses by the end of 2021. Launched in April, the global pact aims to pool funds from wealthier countries and nonprofits to accelerate the development and manufacture of Covid-19 vaccines and distribute them equitably around the world. It has so far secured half of the funding it needs and the US and Russia - key players in vaccine development and manufacture - have not joined, the Johns Hopkins study said.",

Australia’s chief medical officer, Prof Brendan Murphy, said on Friday, \"These sort of events really are dangerous\". However the prime minister, Scott Morrison, announced on the same day that major sports stadiums may allow 10,000 people by July.It follows protests last weekend, when people took to the streets campaigning for an end to Aboriginal deaths in custody. There have been 437 known Aboriginal deaths since the royal commission into Aboriginal deaths in custody delivered its final report in 1991, and yet despite this, change has been slow. The protests were sparked in solidarity with the US following the brutal death of unarmed man George Floyd on 25 May. One man was diagnosed with the virus following the Melbourne protests, with health authorities saying he was likely infected prior to the rally. Victoria police issued fines of $1652 each to the three people who organised the protest. More protests took place in Sydney and Perth on Friday night. About 300 people who gathered in Sydney’s city were outnumbered by about 600 police officers, in an event deemed unlawful because police were not formally notified. The peaceful protest was also brief, ending around 8pm. Two stray observations from today’s protest:1) These guys were already there, protecting the Captain Cook statue - which nobody else ended up going near 2) Saw a few commercial TV reporters and crew who clearly have started hiring their own security  Thousands of protesters will gather in Perth for Saturday’s protest at Langley Park. Organisers have ignored Premier Mark McGowan’s pleas to delay the protest until after the coronavirus pandemic is over. Meanwhile, refugee activists will spread themselves out in Melbourne in an attempt to avoid the same fines issued to the organisers of last weekend’s rally. The group said its rallies will have no more than 20 people in eight different locations to protest against the indefinite detention of asylum seekers.",

Bordering states -- especially New South Wales -- are on high alert after the Victorian premier, Daniel Andrews, announced a record new 288 cases on Friday– the single highest daily rise in any state since the pandemic began. He warned those numbers would increase in the coming days. The lockdown led the government to announce a half-a-billion-dollar stimulus package for affected businesses. Andrews also said Melbourne would stop taking international flight arrivals for at least two weeks, while it worked to get the outbreak under control. There are now 47 people in hospital in the state, including 12 in intensive care. The vast majority of the 288 new cases have been locally acquired. By comparison, New South Wales reported just 14 new cases on Friday, with 12 of those in returned travellers now in hotel quarantine. Meanwhile to ensure more cases of the virus aren’t imported while Victoria grapples to regain control, Australia’s national cabinet, made up of the prime minister and state and territory leaders, decided to cap the number of incoming flights allowed in Australia. The change means at least 4,000 fewer Australians will return home each week. The prime minister, Scott Morrison, acknowledged the change meant \"it will be more difficult\" for Australians to return home. The New South Wales chief health officer Dr Kerry Chant urged the community to be extra vigilant following the closure of the Victorian/ New South Wales border to stop spread of the virus on Wednesday. The border will remain shut for at least six weeks, the first time it has been closed in more than 100 years.",

Early on Saturday, police raided the home of James Bartolo, who runs conspiracy website The Conscious Truth Network, and charged him with incitement. Bartolo, who posted footage of his arrest online, is the fifth Victorian arrested over plans for the illegal \"Freedom Day\" rally. \"Woke up this morning, jumped on the dunny, heard some knocks on the door,\" Bartolo wrote on social media. \"It was all the cops, they broke down the door, arrested me, they took computers, laptops (and my) phone. \"It is a bit of a pain in the ass. They stole my shit. Whatever. I’m fine.\" Bartolo told supporters to not attend today’s rally because he believed it was \"a trap\" \"It is the worst possible thing to do. It is a set-up from the get go. It is all just terrible. Don’t go to that one. What is going to happen, Dan Andrews will blame the protest for the lockdown extension. Don’t go to the protest.\"",

        "news": "After increasing pressure on the Victorian government and its health minister, Jenny Mikakos, due to failures of the state’s hotel quarantine program, Mikakos resigned on Saturday morning. My media statement is attached. #springst It follows a six-week inquiry into the state’s hotel quarantine program for returned international travellers, with infection control failures in the program ultimately sparking Victoria’s second wave. Much of the state is now under strict lockdown restrictions, and borders to other Australian states remain closed or heavily restricted. While most other states and territories opted to use police officer or Australian Defence Force [ADF] staff to implement the hotel quarantine program, Victoria used private security contractors who were poorly trained in infection control, the inquiry previously heard. The premier and health minister have been under pressure to explain why ADF and police were not used. As Guardian Australia reporter Josh Taylor wrote on Friday; In his long-awaited appearance at the hotel quarantine inquiry, Victorian premier Daniel Andrews said he regarded his health minister, Jenny Mikakos, as \"accountable for the program\". The premier’s written statement provided to the inquiry on Friday said Mikakos and jobs minister Martin Pakula were responsible for informing cabinet about the program, and the pair provided a submission on the model for the program to the crisis council of cabinet on 8 April. \"The CCC [crisis council of cabinet] was provided with regular reports by Minister Mikakos containing data relevant to Victoria’s response to the public health emergency, key insights from the data, as well as other updates, including in relation to the program,\" the submission read. The premier stopped short of saying who was behind the decision to use private security guards, but the claim potentially puts Andrews at odds with health minister Jenny Mikakos. The health minister’s statements to the inquiry on Thursday said she was not aware security guards were used in the program until the outbreak at the Rydges Hotel in late May. Mikakos released a statement to the inquiry after Andrews’ submission was released denying she had misled the inquiry. The premier told the inquiry it was \"very disappointing\" that the decision on private security guards was supposedly made by a \"collective\" of officials, with no one taking responsibility. In her resignation letter to the premier on Saturday, Mikakos wrote; \"I am disappointed that my integrity has sought to be undermined\". \"I have today written to the Governor of Victoria to resign my commissions as a minister effective today.\" Mikakos also intends to resign from parliament.",

The Victorian premier, Daniel Andrews, is expected to give a further update this morning in what will be his 100th consecutive day of fronting up to the media. Melbourne has been in a hard lockdown since early July as the state experienced a second wave of the coronavirus. While restrictions have eased in regional areas of the state, in the city a five-kilometre movement restriction for only essential travel and gathering bans remain. That lockdown will stay unless the city’s rolling 14-day average drops to five cases or less, with only five cases of community transmission over that same time. The average right now is 9.4. On Friday the state recorded 11 cases and no deaths. In NSW, that state recorded five new local cases on Friday but these were all linked to a known cluster. A health alert was issued late Friday when a nurse at St Vincent’s Hospital in Sydney tested posted. The nurse \"had limited contact with a very small number of colleagues\", health authorities said. The opening of state borders continues to create political tension in Australia. Queensland, which has only four people currently with the virus, is relatively open, and has its border closed to most of New South Wales and all of Victoria. The NSW premier, Gladys Berejiklian, and the Australian prime minister, Scott Morriso,n have both been trying to pressure Queensland to open up.

Today we’ll be watching the state of Victoria where the premier, Daniel Andrews, is expected to announce some easing of restrictions after more than 100 days of lockdown in Melbourne. The state recorded just one new case of Covid-19 on Saturday. Andrews has said Sunday’s announcements will be \"much more in the social space than in the economic space\", suggesting the government is likely to take a cautious approach to the reopening of businesses. News Corp is reporting this morning the government will scrap two-hour limits on exercise and outdoor social activities, increase the number of people permitted to gather outdoors, and widen Melbourne’s travel limit from 5km to 20km. We’ll bring you updates as they come. On Saturday, the premier rejected pressure from the federal government, including the health minister, Greg Hunt, to ease restrictions in line with the state of New South Wales. Meanwhile, NSW remains on alert as a Covid-19 cluster in south-west Sydney’s Oran Park continues to grow and authorities urge more people to get tested. NSW recorded seven new cases of coronavirus – including five locally-transmitted cases – in the 24 hours to 8pm on Friday from almost 14,400 tests.

Monday will see the resumption of direct flights from New Zealand – the first international flights into Melbourne since 30 June. Ahead of the resumption of international arrivals, a long-awaited report has suggested improvements to the state’s quarantine program, AAP reports. Among the hotel quarantine inquiry’s 69 recommendations is that overseas travellers returning to Victoria should be able to quarantine at home, potentially with an electronic ankle or wrist bracelet to track movements and enforce compliance. Home quarantine candidates would need to have regular Covid-19 tests during the 14-day period and face penalties if found in breach, the report said. The report describes home quarantine as \"at least as effective as a facility-based model\" in preventing transmission and avoids the risk of putting people in \"physical proximity with others suspected of having COVID-19\". It also reduces the number of workers required, \"thereby reducing the number of people potentially being exposed\". Those unable to quarantine at home will be accommodated at hotels located near hospitals and modified for social distancing and minimal transmission risk. Police would be on-site 24/7 alongside units dedicated to infection prevention and control, and contact tracing. Staff will not be allowed to work across multiple quarantine sites or in other forms of employment. Victoria’s second virus wave, which resulted in more than 18,000 infections and 800 deaths, can be traced to outbreaks among staff at the Rydges and Stamford Plaza hotels.",

The UN’s humanitarian chief, Mark Lowcock, said unless more money was raised Yemen \"will face a horrific outcome at the end of the year\". Despite the shortfall \"the UN will not abandon the people of Yemen\", he said, adding that pledging would continue because some of last year’s large donors had not yet contributed. Dr Abdullah al-Rabiah, the head of the King Salman Centre for Relief and Humanitarian Aid in Saudi Arabia, which co-hosted the virtual summit, put the overall shortfall down to the impact of coronavirus on national budgets and concerns about the restrictions on aid flows imposed by the parties to Yemen’s five-year civil war. \"We want to be sure that the money will go to those in need,\" he said.",

        "news": "The United States will leave the World Health Organization on 6 July 2021, the United Nations has said after receiving formal notification of the decision from Washington. The US president Donald Trump had to give one year’s notice of for withdrawal from the Geneva-based UN agency under a 1948 joint resolution of the US Congress, which also obliges Washington to pay financial support. The United States currently owes the WHO more than $200m (approximately £160m) in assessed contributions, according to the WHO website. After more than 70 years of membership, the United States moved to quit the WHO after Trump accused it of becoming a puppet of China amid the pandemic. The virus first emerged in China’s Wuhan city late last year. Stéphane Dujarric, a UN spokesman, said: The secretary general ... is in the process of verifying with the World Health Organization whether all the conditions for such withdrawal are met. Trump had halted US funding for the 194-member organisation in April, then demanded a series of reforms on 18 May, before announcing the decision to pull the US out less than two weeks later. The WHO is an independent international body that works with the United Nations. The UN sSecretary general António Guterres has said the WHO is \"absolutely critical to the world’s efforts to win the war against Covid-19\". Trump has long scorned multilateralism as he focuses on an \"America First\" agenda. Since taking office, he has quit the UN Human Rights Council, the UN cultural agency, a global accord to tackle climate change and the Iran nuclear deal. He has also cut funding for the UN population fund and the UN agency that aids Palestinian refugees.",

        "news": "A new report by Oxfam warns that the hunger crisis worsened by the pandemic could potentially kill more people each day than the infection itself, which has claimed more than half a million lives so far. An estimated 12,000 people per day could die from hunger linked to Covid-19 by the end of the year, Oxfam said. By comparison, data from Johns Hopkins University shows that the pandemic’s deadliest day so far was 17 April, when 8,890 deaths were recorded, CNN reports. \"The pandemic is the final straw for millions of people already struggling with the impacts of conflict, climate change, inequality and a broken food system that has impoverished millions of food producers and workers,\" Oxfam’s interim executive director Chema Vera said in a release. Among the issues that have left many unable to put food on the table are lost income caused by unemployment or a reduction in remittance payments, the lack of social support for those who work in the informal economy, and disruptions to the supply chain and hurdles faced by producers. Also contributing to the crisis are the travel restrictions related to lockdowns, which impact not just workers and farmers, but also the delivery of humanitarian aid. In its briefing, Oxfam calls out food and beverage industry titans like Coca-Cola, Unilever, General Mills among others. \"Meanwhile, those at the top are continuing to make a profit: eight of the biggest food and drink companies paid out over $18 billion to shareholders since January even as the pandemic was spreading across the globe ― ten times more than the UN says is needed to stop people going hungry,\" the release reads.",

        "news": "The World Health Organization has recommended that children over 12 should wear masks in the same contexts as adults in the bid to rein in the Covid-19 pandemic. The UN health agency, in cooperation with UNICEF, published fresh guidance on Friday on when it is appropriate for children to wear masks to impede the spread of the coronavirus crisis. The two UN agencies had convened a group of experts to review the limited data available on children’s contribution to the spread of COVID-19, as well as on the benefits of mask-wearing by children. Based on those findings, as well as considerations surrounding children’s developmental needs, they said the advice varied in different age groups. WHO thus recommends that \"children aged 12 and over should wear a mask under the same conditions as adults, in particular when they cannot guarantee at least a one-metre distance from others and there is widespread transmission in the area.\" The document acknowledged that much remains unknown about to what degree children contribute to the spread of the novel coronavirus. But it said that while there is some limited evidence that young children may have lower susceptibility to infection compared to adults, data indicated that teenagers \"may play a more active role in transmission than younger children\". The UN agencies said that children under five should not wear a mask. It comes after France’s education minister, Jean-Michel Blanquer, said schools will reopen on 1 September as normal, but all staff as well as pupils over the age of 11 must wear masks.",

However, the withdrawal does not take effect until next July, and until then – according to a 72-year-old agreement with Congress – the US is obliged to maintain its financial contributions. By the time of the withdrawal notice, the first tranche of $58m of its \"assessed contributions\" – national membership dues – had already been paid, leaving a second tranche of $65m due this month.

He said the near $3bn contributed so far had been critical for the initial phase since the accelerator’s launch four months ago, but $35bn more was needed to shift from start-up to scale-up - beginning with $15bn in the next three months.

Later Reuters reported the French government would not be joining WHO’s international vaccine programme, a blow to the UN body’s effort to discourage \"vaccine nationalism\". •Canada could lose its ability to manage the coronavirus pandemic owing to a worrying recent surge in Covid-19 cases, the country’s top medical officer has said. The warning from the chief public health officer, Theresa Tam, is the clearest indication yet of how worried authorities in the country are about the potential for the outbreak to spiral out of control. •Facebook said it would no longer show health groups in its recommendations to ensure users get health information from authoritative sources. It said the move reflected its view that such sources of information were \"crucial\". •In the US, New York City once again delayed the return of most of the million-plus students in its public schools. The mayor, Bill de Blasio, said most elementary school students would do remote-only learning until 29 September. •Wuhan, ground zero for the coronavirus outbreak, has reopened for international flights, ending an eight-month moratorium since the disease first emerged. China stopped international flights in March as global alarm increased about the spread of Covid-19, but has now largely brought the disease under control. •The World Health Organization warned of \"alarming rates of transmission\" of Covid-19 across Europe and cautioned countries against shortening quarantine periods.

        "news": "The Australian prime minister, Scott Morrison, is standing firm on his calls for the independent investigation into the origins of the coronavirus and urged all nations to share a vaccine once it is proven. Morrison’s pre-recorded speech on the virtual stage on Saturday morning to the 75th United Nations general assembly, praised the World Health Organization for establishing an inquiry into the global response to coronavirus, AAP reports. \"There is also a clear mandate to identify the zoonotic source of the Covid-19 virus and how it was transmitted to humans,\" he said. \"This virus has inflicted a calamity on our world and its peoples. We must do all we can to understand what happened for no other purpose than to prevent it from happening again.\" The inquiry resolution backed by 145 countries in May does not mention China, instead committing to an impartial, independent and comprehensive evaluation. China eventually supported the European Union motion. Ties between the two nations have since been fraught, with tariffs being imposed on some goods and Australian journalists being evacuated from China. Morrison urged other leaders to share a coronavirus vaccine if they discover one. He has previously said if Australia found a vaccine, it would be shared across the world. \"This is a global responsibility and it’s a moral responsibility for a vaccine to be shared far and wide,\" he said. \"Some might see short-term advantage or even profit. But I assure you to anyone who may think along those lines, humanity will have a very long memory and be a very, very severe judge.\"",

        "news": "Peru has secured enough coronavirus vaccine to give nearly three-quarters of its population at least one dose when the immunization is available, a hopeful development for a nation with one of the highest COVID-19 death rates in the world, reports Reuters. The agreements announced on Friday with Pfizer Inc and global vaccine distribution program COVAX will provide 23.1 million doses for a population of 31.9 million. Some vaccine regimes will require two doses. The Peruvian Ministry of Health said it had signed a binding agreement with Pfizer for the purchase of 9.9 million doses of its vaccine which is in testing. Another 13.2 million doses will be bought through COVAX, which is led by the GAVI vaccines alliance and the World Health Organization and aimed at promoting equitable access. COVAX has signed agreements to buy vaccines from French drugmaker Sanofi, Britain’s GlaxoSmithKline, AstraZeneca and Novavax. Health Minister Pilar Mazzetti said this week that she expects vaccines to arrive in Peru in the first quarter of 2021 before general elections on April 11, and vaccines will likely be administered in voting centers. China’s Sinopharm and the United States’ Johnson &amp; Johnson are conducting trials of their vaccines in the country, potentially allowing Peru to buy doses at a discount, the ministry of health said. Peru has seen 111.55 deaths per 100,000 of its population, ranking third in the world for per capita mortality, according to a Reuters tally.",

The FDA is investigating five reported allergic reactions that occurred in people who received the Pfizer and BioNTech vaccine in the US this week. More from Reuters: Anyone who had a severe reaction to a Covid-19 vaccine should not get the second dose, the CDC said, defining severe as needing the medication epinephrine or treatment in a hospital. People who have had a severe allergic reaction to any ingredient in a Covid-19 vaccine should avoid the vaccine formulation containing the ingredient, agency said. Two vaccines have been approved in the United States under emergency use authorisations. Individuals with histories of severe allergic reaction to vaccines should consult their doctors about the Covid-19 shot. The CDC said people with severe allergies to food, pets, latex or environmental conditions as well as people with allergies to oral medication or a family history of severe allergic reactions could still get vaccinated. The US food and drug administration (FDA) is investigating about five allergic reactions that happened after people were administered Pfizer Inc and BioNTech SE’s Covid vaccine in the US this week. On Friday, the FDA said that the Moderna Inc vaccine, which received emergency use authorisation, should not be given to individuals with a known history of a severe allergic reaction to any components of the shot. Britain’s medical regulator has said that anyone with a history of anaphylaxis or severe allergic reactions to a medicine or food should not be given the Pfizer-BioNTech Covid-19 vaccine.",

I’m doing this to demonstrate that people should be prepared when it’s available to take the vaccine. There’s nothing to worry about. Other top government officials last week joined the first wave of Americans to be inoculated against Covid-19 as part of the largest largest vaccination campaign in the nation’s history. The vice president Mike Pence, the house speaker Nancy Pelosi, the Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell and other lawmakers were given doses on Friday.

Dr Mariangela Simao, WHO assistant director general for Access to Medicines and Health Products, said: This is a very positive step towards ensuring global access to Covid-19 vaccines. But I want to emphasise the need for an even greater global effort to achieve enough vaccine supply to meet the needs of priority populations everywhere. The Pfizer/BioNTech #COVID19 vaccine today became the first vaccine to receive WHO validation for emergency use since the outbreak began.Equitable global access to vaccines is crucial to combat the pandemic.👉  The WHO, together with the GAVI Vaccine Alliance and the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI), are spearheading a global effort called COVAX to distribute vaccines to low- and middle-income countries, to help make sure that shots do not go only to wealthy nations. The COVAX alliance has said it has agreements for nearly 2bn doses, with first deliveries due in early 2021. The alliance has said it has been in talks with Pfizer and BioNTech to secure its vaccine. Pfizer/BioNTech’s messenger RNA vaccine was 95% effective at preventing disease symptoms after two doses 21 days apart. Delivery is challenging, since it needs to be stored at -70C. The vaccine has previously been approved for emergency use in the US and Britain, and has conditional marketing approval in the EU and Switzerland, among other countries, where distribution of shots concentrating on older people and healthcare workers began in December.",

        "news": "Cancer patients with Covid-19 treated with a drug combination promoted by US President Donald Trump to counter coronavirus were three times more likely to die within 30 days than those who got either drug alone, U.S. researchers said. The preliminary results suggest doctors may want to refrain from prescribing the decades-old malaria treatment hydroxychloroquine with the antibiotic azithromycin for these patients until more study is done, researchers said. \"Treatment with hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin were strongly associated with increased risk of death,\" Dr. Howard Burris, president of the American Society of Clinical Oncology(ASCO), said in a briefing with reporters on the results. The drug combination initially was thought to help Covid-19 patients, but recent data has cast doubt. The preliminary findings, to be presented this week at ASCO’s virtual scientific meeting, show that the combination may pose a significant risk to cancer patients. \"Taking the combination gives a three times increased risk of dying within 30 days of any cause,\" Dr. Jeremy Warner of Vanderbilt University Medical System told reporters. Trump, who has often promoted hydroxychloroquine, in a March 21 tweet called the combination potentially \"one of the biggest game changers in the history of medicine.\" That was based on a study of fewer than 40 patients in the International Journal of Antimicrobial Agents. More recent studies have shown little or no benefit and increased risks. Warner and colleagues analysed data on 925 patients with cancer who became infected with the coronavirus between March and April. Thirteen percent of the patients died within 30 days of their diagnosis. Overall, patients whose cancers were actively progressing at the time of infection were five times more likely to die within 30 days than those who were in remission or had no current evidence of cancer. In the trial, 180 patients were taking hydroxychloroquine in combination with azithromycin, and 90 were taking hydroxychloroquine alone. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has allowed healthcare providers to prescribe the drugs for Covid-19 through an emergency-use authorisation, but has not approved the treatment. The governments of France, Italy and Belgium moved on Wednesday to halt the use of hydroxychloroquine for Covid-19 patients following a World Health Organization decision on Monday to pause a large trial of the drug due to safety concerns.",

        "news": "The US Food and Drug Administration has revoked its emergency use authorisation for hydroxychloroquine to treat Covid-19, the drug championed by president Donald Trump. Based on new evidence, the FDA said it was no longer reasonable to believe that oral formulations of hydroxychloroquine and the related drug chloroquine may be effective in treating the illness caused by the coronavirus. The move comes after several studies of the decades-old malaria drug suggested it was not effective, including a widely anticipated trial earlier this month that showed it failed to prevent infection in people who had been exposed to the virus. The drug’s anti-inflammatory and antiviral properties suggested it might help treat Covid-19, and the FDA authorised its emergency use in March. While it did appear to neutralise the virus in laboratory experiments, hydroxychloroquine, which is also used to treat lupus and rheumatoid arthritis, has failed to prove its worth in human Covid-19 trials, thus far. In March, Trump said hydroxychloroquine used in combination with the antibiotic azithromycin had \"a real chance to be one of the biggest game changers in the history of medicine,\" with little evidence to back up that claim. He later said he took the drugs preventively after two people who worked at the White House were diagnosed with Covid-19, and he urged others to try it. Doctors in recent weeks had already pulled back on the use of hydroxychloroquine as a Covid-19 treatment, after several studies suggested it is not effective and may pose heart risks for certain patients. France, Italy and Belgium late last month moved to halt the use of hydroxychloroquine to treat Covid-19 patients. But the United States last month supplied Brazil with 2m doses for use against Covid-19, as the South American country has emerged as the pandemic’s latest epicenter. Meanwhile, some 400 trials are listed as using hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine as interventions for Covid-19, more than half of them still ongoing, according to a recent analysis from research firm GlobalData. In the United States, the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases last month launched a trial designed to show whether hydroxychloroquine in combination with azithromycin can prevent hospitalisation and death from Covid-19.",

        "news": "Turkey’s health minister warned citizens against complacency on Monday as daily coronavirus cases doubled compared with figures in early June, Agence France-Presse reports. The country registered 1,592 new cases and 18 Covid-19 deaths for the past 24 hours, Fahrettin Koca said on his official Twitter account. There were 786 infections in a 24-hour period on 2 June. At the height of the pandemic, Turkey recorded over 5,000 daily cases in April. Koca’s tweets often remonstrate those ignoring the continued dangers from the pandemic. Düne kıyasla vaka sayımız 30, yoğun bakım hasta sayımız 5, entübe hasta sayımız 1 artış gösterdi. ARTIŞLAR BELLİ BÖLGELERDE YOĞUNLAŞIYOR. Rehavet mi, mücadele mi? Maske + mesafe kuralına hep birlikte uyarsak, yayılımı kontrol altına alabiliriz. Güç bizde.  In capital letters, he wrote on Monday: \"The increases are intensifying in certain areas,\" but did not offer further information. \"Will it be complacency or a fight? We will be able to control the spread if we all adhere to the mask and distancing rule,\" Koca added. In recent weeks, Turkey has allowed intercity travel including the resumption of domestic flights, reopened cafes and restaurants, and ended weekend lockdowns. With the latest figures, Turkey’s fatalities have reached 4,825 and the total number of cases are nearly 180,000. Between April and late May, Turkey was under weekend curfews as the government sought to avoid a full lockdown like in France in a bid to keep the economy going.",

Nearly 8,000 cases have been diagnosed in Catalonia over the past 14 days – accounting for almost half of the 16,410 detected across Spain.Catalonia’s public health secretary, Josep Maria Argimon, said the situation in and around Barcelona was \"at a critical moment\" and called on people to heed the regional government’s request not to leave their homes unless strictly necessary. Meanwhile, Norway has said it will reimpose a 10-day quarantine requirement for people arriving from Spain from Saturday after a surge in coronavirus cases there. However, the government also said it would ease restrictions on people coming from more counties of Sweden, according to Reuters.

The UK government will also remove the Netherlands, Monaco, Malta, Turks &amp; Caicos and Aruba from the list, the transport secretary Grant Shapps confirmed.

If you arrive in the UK after 0400 Saturday from these destinations, you will need to self-isolate for 14 days. The decision comes after the Joint Biosecurity Centre and Public Health England indicated a significant change in Covid-19 risk in all six destinations. Department for Transport officials said that data from France shows that over the past week there has been a 66% increase in newly reported cases and a 52% increase in weekly incidence rate per 100,000 population, indicating a sharp rise in Covid-19. There has been a consistent increase in newly reported cases in the Netherlands over the past four weeks, with a 52% increase in newly reported cases between 7 and 13 August. Over the past week, there has been a 273% increase in newly reported cases in Turks &amp; Caicos, a 1,106% increase in newly reported cases in Aruba, and Malta has had a 105% increase.",

        "news": "France registered 3,776 new Covid-19 infections on Wednesday, marking another post-lockdown peak and bringing the total to 225,043, but president Emmanuel Macron again ruled out imposing another national lockdown. \"All the indicators keep going up and the transmission of the virus is getting stronger among all ages groups affected, young adults in particular\", the health ministry said in a statement. It said the virus was especially active in and around Paris and Marseille, the country’s two biggest cities. Some medical experts are worried about the impact of Paris St Germain fans’ wild, mask-less celebrations on the Champs Elysees avenue in central Paris after their soccer club reached the Champions League final on Tuesday. Paris municipal officials are also concerned about large gatherings of fans expected on Sunday, when Paris St Germain will play the final either against Olympique Lyonnais, another French club, or Germany’s Bayern Munich. Despite the surge in infections, Macron told Paris Match magazine in an interview that \"local strategies\" were preferable to another national lockdown, which he said would cause considerable \"collateral damage\". The seven-day moving average of the case tally, which smooths out daily reporting irregularities, is now at 2,621, above the 2,500 threshold for the first time since 19 April, when France was enforcing one of Europe’s strictest lockdowns. The number of people in hospital fell again by 17 to 4,806 and those in intensive care slipped by six to 374, reflecting the preponderance of younger people among the new cases who are more likely to be asymptomatic or not to fall seriously ill. Both numbers had been on an uninterrupted downward trend since early April, but that trend has slowed in the past two weeks. The number of deaths increased by 17 to 30,468, following an increase of 22 on Tuesday and of 19 on Monday.",

        "news": "The World Health Organization has recommended that children over 12 should wear masks in the same contexts as adults in the bid to rein in the Covid-19 pandemic. The UN health agency, in cooperation with UNICEF, published fresh guidance on Friday on when it is appropriate for children to wear masks to impede the spread of the coronavirus crisis. The two UN agencies had convened a group of experts to review the limited data available on children’s contribution to the spread of COVID-19, as well as on the benefits of mask-wearing by children. Based on those findings, as well as considerations surrounding children’s developmental needs, they said the advice varied in different age groups. WHO thus recommends that \"children aged 12 and over should wear a mask under the same conditions as adults, in particular when they cannot guarantee at least a one-metre distance from others and there is widespread transmission in the area.\" The document acknowledged that much remains unknown about to what degree children contribute to the spread of the novel coronavirus. But it said that while there is some limited evidence that young children may have lower susceptibility to infection compared to adults, data indicated that teenagers \"may play a more active role in transmission than younger children\". The UN agencies said that children under five should not wear a mask. It comes after France’s education minister, Jean-Michel Blanquer, said schools will reopen on 1 September as normal, but all staff as well as pupils over the age of 11 must wear masks.",

The move follows targeted measures to reintroduce restrictions on public life in the worst affected parts of the country, as the government tries to tackle the spread of the virus without resorting to a complete lockdown. \"Due to the threat of spreading SARS CoV-2 virus infections, it is necessary to exercise the right to introduce air traffic bans... in order to minimize the threat to public health,\" the regulation said.

However, it progressively loosened restrictions on public life, with shopping centres, hotels and restaurants all reopening in May. Polish national airline PLL LOT resumed international flights on 1 July almost four months after suspending them.

        "news": "Several large US states including Texas are not heeding new federal health officials’ calls to reduce Covid-19 testing of some exposed to the virus, joining a broad rebuke of the Trump administration by public health leaders. Arizona, California, Connecticut, Florida, Illinois, Texas, New Jersey and New York all plan to continue to test asymptomatic people who have been exposed to Covid-19, despite new guidance from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) suggesting that such tests may not be needed. \"The current Texas guidance recommends testing for all close contacts of a confirmed case because it allows for early case identification among people who are at a higher risk of infection,\" a spokesman for the Texas Department of State Health Services in a statement. \"There’s not a planned change at this point.\" California and New York made similar statements. The Florida Department of Health said asymptomatic testing was continuing while the new CDC recommendations were evaluated, and Texas also said it would evaluate. The CDC said this week that people exposed to Covid-19 but not symptomatic may not need to be tested, shocking doctors and politicians, and prompting accusations the guidance was politically motivated. Even before the CDC guidance, coronavirus testing in the US had dropped. The US tested on average 675,000 people a day last week, down from a peak in late July of over 800,000 people a day. Nationally, cases have fallen for five weeks in a row but infections are surging again in the US Midwest with four states reporting record one-day increases in cases on Thursday as the US death toll climbed above 180,000. The CDC had previously recommended testing of all people who had close contact with someone who was diagnosed with Covid-19. New York governor Andrew Cuomo said the state of New York would not be abiding by the new guidance and challenged the assertion that politics played no role in the change. \"This 180-degree reversal of Covid-19 testing guidelines is reckless, and not based on science and has the potential to do long-term damage to the (CDC’s) reputation,\" Cuomo said in a joint statement, along with the governors of New Jersey and Connecticut, who also said their states would not be following the CDC’s guidance. Admiral Brett Giroir, the assistant secretary for health at the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), said there was no political pressure from the administration. He said that testing asymptomatic patients too early could produce false negatives and contribute to the virus’s spread. CNN and The New York Times reported on Wednesday that US public health officials were ordered by high-level members of the Trump administration to push forward with the changes. CDC director Robert Redfield issued a statement on Thursday that \"everyone who needs a Covid-19 test, can get a test,\" but \"everyone who wants a test does not necessarily need a test.\" Globally, many nations advocate early testing. The World Health Organization on Thursday said, that resources permitting, people exposed to the coronavirus should be tested even if they do not show immediate symptoms of infection. European governments have used broad testing and isolation to control the virus. France, for instance, recommends that anyone who thinks they need a test should get one and in Germany, people with close contact of 15 minutes or more with a person with Covid-19 are advised to have a test.",

The previous high was 10,561 new cases in a day, recorded on 12 September. The sharp increase is a result of a higher infection rate but also of a massive increase in testing, Reuters reports. The government has made Covid-19 testing free, resulting in long queues at testing centres in cities across France. The number of people who have died from the virus in France increased by 50 to 31,095, the second-highest tally in two months following the 80 deaths reported on 11 September.",

        "news": "Here’s a summary of recent events: •France identified Lyon and Nice as virus \"red zones\", where additional measures would be needed to control the spread of Covid-19. Later Reuters reported the French government would not be joining WHO’s international vaccine programme, a blow to the UN body’s effort to discourage \"vaccine nationalism\". •Canada could lose its ability to manage the coronavirus pandemic owing to a worrying recent surge in Covid-19 cases, the country’s top medical officer has said. The warning from the chief public health officer, Theresa Tam, is the clearest indication yet of how worried authorities in the country are about the potential for the outbreak to spiral out of control. •Facebook said it would no longer show health groups in its recommendations to ensure users get health information from authoritative sources. It said the move reflected its view that such sources of information were \"crucial\". •In the US, New York City once again delayed the return of most of the million-plus students in its public schools. The mayor, Bill de Blasio, said most elementary school students would do remote-only learning until 29 September. •Wuhan, ground zero for the coronavirus outbreak, has reopened for international flights, ending an eight-month moratorium since the disease first emerged. China stopped international flights in March as global alarm increased about the spread of Covid-19, but has now largely brought the disease under control. •The World Health Organization warned of \"alarming rates of transmission\" of Covid-19 across Europe and cautioned countries against shortening quarantine periods. The body said the number of coronavirus cases in September \"should serve as a wake-up call for all of us\". That’s all from me. Lucy Campbell will pick up the baton shortly.",

French health authorities reported 13,498 new confirmed coronavirus cases on Saturday, setting another record in daily additional infections since the disease started to spread in the country. The number of people in France who have died from Covid-19 was up by 26, at 31,274, and the cumulative number of cases now totals 442,194, as the seven-day moving average of daily new infections rose to more than 9,700, compared with a low of 272 at the end of May, two weeks after the lockdown was lifted. A faster circulation of the virus and a six-fold increase in testing since the government made it free are the two main reasons for the scale of the increase, epidemiologists have said, according to Reuters. Health authorities reported a sudden jump in the country’s daily death toll from Covid-19 on Friday because of unreported cases in one hospital near Paris.",

        "news": "France’s health minister has unveiled a map of coronavirus \"danger zones\" around the country, with bars and restaurants closed from Saturday in Marseille. Olivier Véran told a news conference the country would be divided into zones by alert level with Marseille, the second-largest city, and the French Caribbean island of Guadeloupe for now the only two areas put on the \"maximum\" alert level. Paris and its suburbs along with Lille, Toulouse and six other cities were declared \"reinforced danger zones\", Véran added. \"Should the sanitary situation worsen further in those areas, then a state of health emergency would be put in place\", the minister said. Like other European countries where the infection rate has soared in the past month, France has been gradually tightening limits on public and private gatherings locally, hoping it will be enough to contain the disease and avoid a second national lockdown. After a summer lull, president Emmanuel Macron’s government has been keen to let local authorities adopt measures locally depending on the severity of Covid-19 outbreaks, rather than taking broad measures from the central government in Paris. In Paris and the other cities now labelled \"reinforced danger zones\", attendance at major events will be limited to 1,000 people from the 5,000 allowed now, pre-planned events such as student parties will be banned, and bars and restaurants will have to close at 10pm at the latest. Two government sources said Paris mayor Anne Hidalgo had strongly resisted restrictions on the opening hours of bars and cafes in the capital, arguing that this would be economically devastating for the sector. Among other measures, there will be a ban on public gatherings of more than 10 people and, in \"maximum\" alert level areas like Marseille, bars and restaurants will be closed from Saturday.",

        "news": "Some more detail on news the Dutch government has tightened some of Europe’s most relaxed coronavirus rules after a surge in cases, ordering bars to shut early and recommending people wear masks in shops. The prime minister, Mark Rutte, told a news conference that the situation in the country’s three largest cities, Amsterdam, Rotterdam and The Hague, had become \"serious\" and required urgent action. \"We’re doing our best, but the virus is doing better,\" said the country’s health minister, Hugo de Jonge, adding that nearly 3,000 new infections were being recorded a day, with the figure expected to reach 5,000 within weeks. The Netherlands has so far avoided the harsh measures introduced by its European neighbours, preferring a so-called \"intelligent lockdown\" and refusing to order the wearing of masks. But people were now advised to wear masks while shopping in the three big cities, with retailers allowed to refuse entry to those who did not, Rutte said. However, Rutte said that masks - which are already compulsory on public transport – \"won’t do the big trick\" and had not worked in France or Spain by themselves. Restaurants and bars must now close at 10pm, while people may only have four people to visit over the age of 13, Rutte said. Sports matches will be played behind closed doors again, including top-tier Eredivisie football, which had only just begun its new season with a limited number of spectators. Rutte had warned fans recently to \"keep their mouths shut\" after many had defied a ban on chanting. Working from home should once again become standard, de Jonge said.",

        "title": "No clear link between school opening and Covid surge, study finds",
        "news": "Widespread reopening of schools after lockdowns and vacations is generally not linked to rising Covid-19 rates, a study of 191 countries has found, but lockdown closures will leave a 2020 \"pandemic learning debt\" of 300bn missed school days. The analysis, by the Geneva-based independent educational foundation Insights for Education, said 84% of those 300bn days would be lost by children in poorer countries, and warned that 711 million pupils were still out of school. \"It’s been assumed that opening schools will drive infections, and that closing schools will reduce transmission, but the reality is much more complex,\" said IfE’s founder and chief executive Randa Grob-Zakhary. The vast majority – 92% – of countries that are through their first wave of Covid-19 infections have started to reopen school systems, even as some are seeing a second surge. IfE found that 52 countries – including France and Spain – that sent students back to school in August and September saw infection rates rise during the vacation compared to when they were closed. In Britain and Hungary, however, infection levels dropped after initial school closures, remained low during the holidays, and began rising after reopening. Full analysis of these 52 countries found no firm correlation between school status and infections – pointing to a need to consider other factors, IfE said. \"The key now is to learn from those countries that are reopening effectively against a backdrop of rising infections,\" Grob-Zakhary said. The report said 44 countries have kept schools closed. It found countries are developing strategies for schools during the pandemic, such as in Italy and France, which order temporary school closures on a case-by-case basis. Other measures include policies on masks, class rotations and combining remote with in-school lessons. Grob-Zakhary said: This first real global test highlights what school life looks like in a Covid-world. Understanding how countries undergoing a massive second wave are dealing with this new reality in the classroom is essential to guide future reopening decisions and to help schools remain open.",

        "news": "Italy has made it mandatory to wear face masks outdoors nationwide in an effort to curb the spread of the coronavirus, as new infections rose to the highest daily tally since April. The decree was approved at a cabinet meeting after a steady increase in cases over the last two months. It will probably be effective from Thursday, a government source said. Several Italian regions including Lazio, around the capital Rome, had already made face masks mandatory. Data from the health ministry showed 3,678 cases were reported in the last 24 hours, up from 2,677 on Tuesday and surging past the 3,000 mark for the first time since 24 April. Italy is still recording far fewer daily cases than other large European countries such as France, Spain and the UK. As a part of Rome’s effort to curb the spread of the virus, the health minister Roberto Speranza on Wednesday ordered compulsory testing on travellers from the United Kingdom, Belgium, the Netherlands and Czech Republic [see 8.35pm]. Italy was the first country in Europe to be hard-hit by Covid-19 and has the second highest death toll in the continent after the UK, with 36,061 deaths recorded since the outbreak began in February, according to official figures. Thanks to one of the strictest lockdowns in the world, the government managed to get the virus under control by the summer but infections are now rising fast. However, daily Covid-related deaths remain far lower than during the first wave of Italy’s epidemic six months ago. Some 31 people died on Wednesday, the health ministry said, while 24 April, the last day with more than 3,000 cases, saw 420 deaths. The cabinet on Wednesday also approved a decree to extend the Covid-19 state of emergency to 31 January. The state of emergency, originally due to expire in mid-October, gives greater powers to central government, making it easier for officials to bypass the bureaucracy that smothers much decision-making in Italy.",

Europe, which successfully damped down the first surge of infections, has emerged as the new coronavirus epicentre in recent weeks and is reporting on average 140,000 cases a day over the past week. As a region, Europe is reporting more daily cases than India, Brazil and the US combined. Of every 100 infections reported around the world, 34 were from European countries, according to a Reuters analysis. The region is currently reporting a million new infections about every nine days and has reported more than 6.3 million cases since the pandemic began. Major European countries - the UK, France, Russia, the Netherlands and Spain - accounted for about half of Europe’s new cases in the week to 18 October. France is reporting the highest seven-day average of new cases in Europe with 19,425 infections per day followed by the United Kingdom, Russia, Spain and the Netherlands in the list of worst affected European countries. Several European countries are closing schools, cancelling elective surgeries and enlisting student medics as the authorities face a Covid-19 resurgence. Russia is moving students to online learning and Northern Ireland is closing schools for two weeks and restaurants for four. In Spain, authorities in Catalonia ordered bars and restaurants to close for 15 days and limited the numbers of people allowed in shops. The Czech Republic has also shifted schools to distance learning and plans to call up thousands of medical students. Hospitals are cutting non-urgent medical procedures to free up beds. Polish health officials have warned the country is on the brink of a disaster as a record 6,526 new coronavirus infections and 116 deaths were reported this week. Poland is ramping up training for nurses and considering creating military field hospitals. Latin America is the worst-affected region with about 27% of total Covid-19 cases followed by Asia, North America and Europe. India is reporting fewer cases this month compared with September, with 69,000 cases per day. The numbers have fallen by more than 20,400 over the last three weeks, down 22% from its previous peak. India reported 55,342 cases on 13 October, its lowest daily increase since 18 August. In the US, which has the largest total number of cases and deaths in the world, new infections are edging higher along with the most hospitalised Covid-19 patients since early September.",

He said it is predicted that by mid-November all intensive care beds will be filled with Covid-19 cases and that France needs a sudden \"brutal brake\" on the transmission of the virus so doctors don’t have to make choices between Covid cases and car accident cases, for example. Efforts made were useful but not enough...The speed of the spread of virus has not been anticipated. Difficult measures have been taken... but they are not enough to combat the second wave. We are overwhelmed by a second wave, that will be harder and more fatal than the first. \"We have to admit, like our neighbours we are submerged by acceleration of the spread of the virus. We are all in Europe surprised by the speed of spread of the virus. We are overwhelmed by a second wave, that will be harder and more fatal than the first.",

        "news": "President Macron has imposed a new nationwide lockdown in France as Covid-19 cases surge. The new measures echo the eight-week lockdown that France enforced in the spring, when hospitalisations and deaths caused by Covid-19 reached a peak. Signed documents will once again be needed for people to leave home and moving between regions will no longer be possible. People can only leave the house to buy essential goods, seek medical attention, or use their daily one-hour allocation of exercise. But unlike the previous lockdown, most schools are to remain open, Macron said, while universities will revert to online teaching and working from home will be generalised. Visits to care homes will still be allowed, as will funerals, Macron said. France has just reported 244 new deaths from coronavirus over the previous 24 hours and 36,437 new confirmed coronavirus cases, taking the total to 1,235,132.",

        "news": "The Dutch prime minister Mark Rutte has ordered extra lockdown measures to slow the spread of the coronavirus in the Netherlands, and said the government is also considering curfews and school closures. The new measures, which include a ban on public meetings of more than two people not in the same family, were imposed amid signs the epidemic had reached a second peak. Rutte said in a televised press conference: The number of new cases is falling, but not quickly enough. The measures go into effect on Wednesday for two weeks. Rutte said other measures will remain in place through mid-December. Bars and restaurants in the Netherlands were closed except for takeaway and delivery in a partial lockdown on 13 October to slow a second wave of infections. Public gatherings were then limited to four people. Rutte on Tuesday said museums, theatres, cinemas, zoos and amusement parks will also have to close. The Netherlands joins the UK, France, Germany and several smaller European countries in restricting gatherings and people’s movements in recent weeks. On Tuesday the National Institute for Health reported 64,087 new cases over the past week, down from 67,542 the week before, the first time weekly numbers have declined since August. Hospitals are near capacity because of a surge in patients with Covid-19, numbers of which are continuing to climb, and the government is under pressure to ease the strain on the healthcare system.",

        "news": "France’s daily Covid-19 death toll rose by 854 on Tuesday, an increase unseen since 15 April, while the number of people hospitalised for the disease went up by more than a 1,000 for the fifth time in nine days. And if the number of new infections, at 36,330, was sharply down versus Monday’s all-time high of 52,518, the seven-day moving average of additional cases, which evens out reporting irregularities, reached a record for a second day in a row, at 43,438. France reinstated a one-month national lockdown on Friday to try and contain the resurgence of the pandemic but it generally takes two weeks for restrictive measures to have some effect. Authorities could nonetheless reimpose a night curfew on Paris and possibly the surrounding region in the coming days amid frustration that too many people are ignoring lockdown rules. The cumulative number of cases now totals 1,502,763, the fifth-highest in the world, and the death toll stands at 38,289, the seventh-highest globally. The sharp rise of the daily death toll is in part due to the fact the nursing homes fatalities are taken in account twice a week, on Tuesdays and on Fridays. The number of hospitalisations is now at 26,265, a figure multiplied by almost six since an August 29 low of 4,530 and getting closer to the 14 April peak of 32,292. France’s first lockdown, imposed between 17 March and 11 May, had been decided to prevent the hospital system from being overwhelmed. The number of people in intensive care units increased by 148, to 3,878, a six-month high but still some way from the 8 April peak of 7,148.",

On Tuesday, the ministry reported 1,259,366 cases. Unlike France, Germany and the UK, which have imposed nationwide lockdowns, Spain has adopted a regional response to tackling the pandemic, leading to a patchwork of different regulations. Murcia on Wednesday joined several other regions including Catalonia in shutting down bars and restaurants, while the northern region of Cantabria banned citizens from travelling across municipal borders. Health minister Salvador Illa told a news conference it would take two to three weeks for the latest regional restrictions to produce effect, but added that \"there is still margin to take additional measures, there are a great many steps we can still take\", without specifying.",

Castex said that one in four deaths in the country were due to the virus and that while the R number was now below 1, it was too early to contemplate relaxing measures. He told a news conference: It would be irresponsible to soften the lockdown now. The gains (we are seeing) are fragile. The prime minister said that if the slowdown in the rate of new cases was maintained, France would pass the peak of the second wave early next week. But he said he would not hesitate to impose stricter measures if the spread of infections quickened once more. The virus has killed more than 42,000 people in France. Health authorities reported 35,879 new cases on Wednesday, taking the total to 1.86 million, overtaking Russia and making France the worst-affected country in the European region. \"The pressure on our hospitals has intensified enormously,\" the French prime minister said.

        "news": "France will start easing its Covid-19 lockdown this weekend so that by Christmas, shops, theatres and cinemas will re-open and people will be able to spend the holiday with the rest of their family, French president Emmanuel Macron has said. In a televised address to the nation, Macron said the worst of the second wave of the epidemic in France was over, but that restaurants, cafes and bars would have to stay shut until 20 January to avoid triggering a third wave. \"We must do everything to avoid a third wave, do everything to avoid a third lockdown,\" Macron said. After curfew measures in major French cities in mid-October failed to produce the results the government had hoped for, it enforced a one-month lockdown on 30 October, though it was less strict than a lockdown that ran from 17 March to 11 May. Positive trends including a decline in hospitalisations for Covid-19 infections, combined with pressure from business lobbies who say they are facing ruin, have led to calls to start loosening the lockdown as soon as possible. Macron also said he would start a vaccination campaign at the end of December or beginning of January, starting with the most vulnerable and older people. Vaccination won’t be mandatory, he said. The Guardian’s foreign correspondent Kim Willsher has more information on the exact details of the eased restrictions: From 15 December:*lockdown lifted can travel between regions and spend Xmas with family*inside extra curricular school activities can resume•avoid unnecessary travel. Not Xmas holidays \"as before\"*Cinema, theatres museums to open with extra health controls",

The Italian health ministry said that 649 people had died from the virus in the previous 24 hours and that 19,903 new cases had been diagnosed. Worldwide, the US has reported the highest number of Covid-19 deaths, with 295,539 as of Saturday morning, followed by Brazil, India and Mexico. According to the AFP tally for Europe, Italy overtook Britain, which has reported 64,026 deaths and is followed by France with 57,567 and Spain with 47,624. Italy was the first European country to suffer a wave of infections earlier this year. The UK’s toll overtook that of Italy on 6 May, with close to 30,000 fatalities, and for a while over the summer the southern European nation appeared to have weathered the storm. But despite the introduction of mass testing, cases began rising again in early autumn, as they did in many other nations - and deaths inevitably followed. Italy’s national medical association said Friday that a total of 251 doctors have now died from the virus. \"In this second wave, it is mainly general practitioners who are paying the highest toll,\" warned Filippo Anelli, head of the FNOMCeO association. He blamed \"greater circulation\" of asymptomatic patients, but added that all doctors did not have the necessary protective equipment. \"We must put an end to this massacre,\" he said.",

The class action, which includes complaints from the families of three passengers who died of Covid-19, accuses the Italy-based cruise giant of negligence and various faults during their trip on the Costa Magica. From 6 to 13 March the ship was refused to dock in most of the Caribbean islands it visited, including Trinidad and Tobago, Grenada, Barbados and Saint Lucia. In the absence of stopovers, the crew encouraged the passengers to use the ship’s shops, spas, restaurants and casino without sufficiently putting health measures in place, or informing them there were suspected infections onboard, the complainants said in their suit. The staff members on the ship \"were at fault, the passengers had almost no information and only found out from local media that there were cases on the ship,\" lawyer Philippe Courtois, who represents the collective of some 850 French passengers, told AFP. Courtois also criticised the \"extremely light\" virus measures on the ship. \"It was meant to be a dream cruise, but it ended in an ordeal,\" he said.

        "news": "The Welsh government has added three more Greek islands to its quarantine list just hours before restrictions come into force. From 4am on Wednesday, travellers arriving in Wales from Santorini, Serifos and Tinos will have to self-isolate for 14 days. Health minster Vaughan Gething said in a statement on Tuesday evening that he reviewed the latest assessments by the Joint Biosecurity Centre (JBC) before making the decision. This follows an announcement made on Thursday in which travellers arriving from Portugal, Gibraltar, French Polynesia as well as the Greek islands of Mykonos, Zakynthos, Lesvos, Paros, Antiparos and Crete were told to self isolate from 4am the following day. This latest measure comes after the Department for Transport announced quarantine measures for travellers arriving in England from the named Greek islands – with the exception of Paros and Antiparos – on Monday. This forms part of the government’s new regional approach to quarantine policy, in which islands can be added or removed from the quarantine list should infection rates differ from their mainland countries.",

        "news": "Peru has secured enough coronavirus vaccine to give nearly three-quarters of its population at least one dose when the immunization is available, a hopeful development for a nation with one of the highest COVID-19 death rates in the world, reports Reuters. The agreements announced on Friday with Pfizer Inc and global vaccine distribution program COVAX will provide 23.1 million doses for a population of 31.9 million. Some vaccine regimes will require two doses. The Peruvian Ministry of Health said it had signed a binding agreement with Pfizer for the purchase of 9.9 million doses of its vaccine which is in testing. Another 13.2 million doses will be bought through COVAX, which is led by the GAVI vaccines alliance and the World Health Organization and aimed at promoting equitable access. COVAX has signed agreements to buy vaccines from French drugmaker Sanofi, Britain’s GlaxoSmithKline, AstraZeneca and Novavax. Health Minister Pilar Mazzetti said this week that she expects vaccines to arrive in Peru in the first quarter of 2021 before general elections on April 11, and vaccines will likely be administered in voting centers. China’s Sinopharm and the United States’ Johnson &amp; Johnson are conducting trials of their vaccines in the country, potentially allowing Peru to buy doses at a discount, the ministry of health said. Peru has seen 111.55 deaths per 100,000 of its population, ranking third in the world for per capita mortality, according to a Reuters tally.",

Phillips, a member of the ruling Progressive Conservative party in the Canadian province, admitted this week he had travelled to the French island of St Barts on 13 December after the legislative session ended.

Posts on Phillips’s social media accounts suggested he remained home over Christmas. Ford said he has asked Peter Bethlenfalvy to step into the finance minister’s role and deliver the government’s 2021 budget in addition to his current role as president of the province’s treasury board. Phillips served as Ontario’s minister of the environment before becoming finance minister as part of a 2019 cabinet reshuffle. He returned to Canada on Thursday and apologised for his actions.

        "news": "Nearly one in four people may not get Covid-19 vaccines until at least 2022 because rich countries with less than 15% of the global population have reserved 51% of the doses of the most promising vaccines, researchers said. Low- and middle-income countries - home to more than 85% of the world’s population - would have to share the remainder, said researchers from the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health in the US. An effective response to the pandemic requires high-income countries \"to share in an equitable distribution of Covid-19 vaccines across the world\", they wrote. \"The uncertainty over global access to Covid-19 vaccines traces not only to ongoing clinical testing, but also from the failure of governments and vaccine manufacturers to be more transparent and accountable over these arrangements,\" they added. As of 15 November, high-income nations had pre-ordered nearly 7.5bn doses of vaccines from 13 manufacturers, the paper said. This included Japan, Australia and Canada who collectively have more than 1bn doses but accounted for less than 1% of current Covid-19 cases, it said. Even if leading manufacturers’ vaccines reach their projected maximum production capacity, nearly 25% of the world’s population may not get the vaccines for another year or more, according to the paper. The People’s Vaccine Alliance coalition last week said pharmaceutical companies should openly share their technology and intellectual property through the World Health Organization so that more doses can be manufactured. The John Hopkins researchers said WHO’s COVAX Facility could play a key role in ensuring fairer access to approved vaccines but it has only secured 500m doses, far below its target of delivering at least 2bn doses by the end of 2021. Launched in April, the global pact aims to pool funds from wealthier countries and nonprofits to accelerate the development and manufacture of Covid-19 vaccines and distribute them equitably around the world. It has so far secured half of the funding it needs and the US and Russia - key players in vaccine development and manufacture - have not joined, the Johns Hopkins study said.",

The western state of Maharashtra, Tamil Nadu in the south and West Bengal in the east - business hubs and home to India’s busiest airports - had said they were not prepared to open for flights as coronavirus cases rose, state government officials said. Maharashtra and Tamil Nadu agreed to operate limited flights from Monday, while southern state of Andhra Pradesh would allow flights from Tuesday, India’s civil aviation minister, Hardeep Singh Puri, said on Twitter. \"It has been a long day of hard negotiations with various state government to recommence civil aviation operations in the country ...

It has been a long day of hard negotiations with various state govts to recommence civil aviation operations in the country.

West Bengal urged the central government to postpone the resumption of passenger flights to Kolkata as it focuses on rescue work after Cyclone Amphan hit the city. Limited aviation operations in West Bengal will commence from Thursday, Puri said.

With nearly 4 million confirmed cases, the virus has killed over 120,000 people in Brazil. But the level of average daily deaths dropped below 900 per day last week - the lowest in three and a half months and below the rate of both the United States and India, according to a Reuters tally.Researchers at Imperial College London also calculate that the transmission rate in Brazil, at which each person infected with the coronavirus infects another person, is now below 1, the level required for new infections to slow. However, the rate previously fell below 1 in August, only to rebound a week later, according to Imperial.The government statistics are also volatile. On Tuesday and Wednesday, Brazil registered more than 1,100 deaths each day, and experts say it is too early to say the worst is over.\"We are on a downward trend compared to the previous high plateau,\" said Roberto Medronho, an infectious diseases expert at the Federal University of Rio de Janeiro. \"But, the numbers are still high and we have to remain vigilant so that it doesn’t grow again.\"",

Europe, which successfully damped down the first surge of infections, has emerged as the new coronavirus epicentre in recent weeks and is reporting on average 140,000 cases a day over the past week. As a region, Europe is reporting more daily cases than India, Brazil and the US combined. Of every 100 infections reported around the world, 34 were from European countries, according to a Reuters analysis. The region is currently reporting a million new infections about every nine days and has reported more than 6.3 million cases since the pandemic began. Major European countries - the UK, France, Russia, the Netherlands and Spain - accounted for about half of Europe’s new cases in the week to 18 October. France is reporting the highest seven-day average of new cases in Europe with 19,425 infections per day followed by the United Kingdom, Russia, Spain and the Netherlands in the list of worst affected European countries. Several European countries are closing schools, cancelling elective surgeries and enlisting student medics as the authorities face a Covid-19 resurgence. Russia is moving students to online learning and Northern Ireland is closing schools for two weeks and restaurants for four. In Spain, authorities in Catalonia ordered bars and restaurants to close for 15 days and limited the numbers of people allowed in shops. The Czech Republic has also shifted schools to distance learning and plans to call up thousands of medical students. Hospitals are cutting non-urgent medical procedures to free up beds. Polish health officials have warned the country is on the brink of a disaster as a record 6,526 new coronavirus infections and 116 deaths were reported this week. Poland is ramping up training for nurses and considering creating military field hospitals. Latin America is the worst-affected region with about 27% of total Covid-19 cases followed by Asia, North America and Europe. India is reporting fewer cases this month compared with September, with 69,000 cases per day. The numbers have fallen by more than 20,400 over the last three weeks, down 22% from its previous peak. India reported 55,342 cases on 13 October, its lowest daily increase since 18 August. In the US, which has the largest total number of cases and deaths in the world, new infections are edging higher along with the most hospitalised Covid-19 patients since early September.",

        "news": "Italy on Saturday became the European country with the highest official number of Covid fatalities, as its new total of 64,036 deaths overtook Britain, according to an Agence France-Presse tally. The Italian health ministry said that 649 people had died from the virus in the previous 24 hours and that 19,903 new cases had been diagnosed. Worldwide, the US has reported the highest number of Covid-19 deaths, with 295,539 as of Saturday morning, followed by Brazil, India and Mexico. According to the AFP tally for Europe, Italy overtook Britain, which has reported 64,026 deaths and is followed by France with 57,567 and Spain with 47,624. Italy was the first European country to suffer a wave of infections earlier this year. The UK’s toll overtook that of Italy on 6 May, with close to 30,000 fatalities, and for a while over the summer the southern European nation appeared to have weathered the storm. But despite the introduction of mass testing, cases began rising again in early autumn, as they did in many other nations - and deaths inevitably followed. Italy’s national medical association said Friday that a total of 251 doctors have now died from the virus. \"In this second wave, it is mainly general practitioners who are paying the highest toll,\" warned Filippo Anelli, head of the FNOMCeO association. He blamed \"greater circulation\" of asymptomatic patients, but added that all doctors did not have the necessary protective equipment. \"We must put an end to this massacre,\" he said.",

        "news": "British drugmaker AstraZeneca told Reuters its Covid-19 vaccine should be effective against the new coronavirus variant, adding studies were underway to fully probe the impact of the mutation. \"AZD1222 (AstraZeneca’s vaccine candidate) contains the genetic material of the SARS-CoV-2 virus spike protein, and the changes to the genetic code seen in this new viral strain do not appear to change the structure of the spike protein,\" an AstraZeneca representative said. Drugmakers are scrambling to test their Covid-19 vaccines against the new fast-spreading variant of the virus that is spreading in Britain, the latest challenge in the breakneck race to curb the pandemic. \"Through vaccination with AZD1222, the body’s immune system is trained to recognise many different parts of the spike protein, so that it can eliminate the virus if it is later exposed,\" the AstraZeneca representative added. The mutation, known as the B.1.1.7 lineage, may be up to 70% more infectious and more of a concern for children. It has sown chaos in Britain, prompting a wave of travel bans that are disrupting trade with Europe. The AstraZeneca-Oxford shot is considered vital for lower-income countries and those in hot climates because it is cheaper, easier to transport and can be stored for long periods at normal refrigerator temperatures. Data from AstraZeneca’s late-stage trials in the UK and Brazil released earlier this month showed the vaccine had efficacy of 62% for trial participants given two full doses, but 90% for a smaller sub-group given a half, then a full dose. Reuters reported late on Tuesday that India is likely to approve AstraZeneca’s vaccine for emergency use by next week.",

We’re getting a little more now from the press conference (given online, not in person) by the Chinese foreign ministry. The government has been at pains to emphasise that it has the tools to control the spread of this coronavirus outbreak, but this morning did concede it needs help – in the form of protective medical equipment. \"What China urgently needs at present are medical masks, protective suits and safety goggles,\" the foreign ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying said in a press briefing on Monday morning. China’s factories can produce 20 million masks a day, but panic over the virus has prompted people in the country of 1.4 billion to stock up on them, while frontline medical personnel have reported equipment shortages. Agence France-Presse provides this context: At full capacity, China’s factories are only able to produce around 20m masks a day, according to the ministry of industry. The foreign ministry said countries including South Korea, Japan, Kazakhstan and Hungary had donated medical supplies. Tian Yulong, of the industry ministry, said earlier on Monday that authorities were taking steps to bring in masks from Europe, Japan and the US, adding that supply and demand in China remained in \"tight equilibrium\" as factories returned to production after the lunar new year break. He said they were now operating at between 60% and 70% capacity. In addition to Hubei, the province of more than 50 million people at the centre of the outbreak, several other provinces and cities across China have made it compulsory to wear masks in public. These include Guangdong – China’s most populous province – plus Sichuan, Jiangxi, Liaoning and the city of Nanjing, with a combined population of more than 300 million.",

He explained that while China reported an extra 13,332 clinically confirmed cases in Hubei province today, these \"relate to a period going back days and weeks\" and have been retrospectively classified based on diagnosis by medical professionals while awaiting laboratory test confirmation. We’re not dealing with a spike of cases of 14,000 in one day. This does not represent a significant change in the trajectory of the virus. It remains unclear whether the spike in deaths reported by China - an additional 254 fatalities - relate to these clinically confirmed cases or not. Ryan, the executive director of the WHO health emergencies programme, said that apart from the Diamond Princess cruise ship, which now has 218 confirmed cases, there has been no dramatic transmission outside China. \"The iceberg may not be that great, but that’s not a guarantee,\" he added. The rest of a special WHO team is expected to arrive in China over the coming weekend to investigative the epicentre of the coronavirus outbreak, he announced. When asked about the most urgent action need to tackle the epidemic, Ryan raised a few issues. He said the clinical trials in China should be expanded to countries such as Japan and Singapore, in order to better understand which treatments are effective. \"Knowing which drugs work would be a wonderful gift,\" he said, adding that antivirals used during the Sars and Mers epidemics are being trialled.

He said that while vaccines and new drugs will take a lot longer to produce, there is no time to be wasted in investment and development. He added that it will take hundreds of millions of dollars of investment in multiple drug candidates to find a solution, and states are going to have to support the private sector in this endeavour. Finally, he said \"we need a vaccine against misinformation\" to better inform the public about the disease and communicate in a more effective way.",

        "news": "Speaking at Arrowe Park, where the British citizens brought home from the Diamond Princess cruise ship in Japan are headed, the chief executive of Wirral teaching hospital NHS trust, Janelle Holmes, said: There was a lot of preparation that went in for our Wuhan guests who successfully left and had been really appreciative of the support and help that we provided. That has given us a blueprint for building on that for the new arrival of guests. I was pleased for the staff and partners who had spent such lot of time making sure their stay was as comfortable as possible and clearly I think because we did such a good job we were asked to support this group of travellers that are coming back from a cruise in Japan. The group of people is slightly different. Obviously they have come from a cruise ship rather than from their own homes over in China but we are working exactly the same as we did before with the healthcare professionals and Public Health England to make sure they are safe, well managed and comfortable while they are with us. Holmes praised the support of the local community – including donations from schools and scout groups – for evacuees based at Arrowe Park and also thanked staff previously living in the quarantine accommodation blocks for their patience as they stay in nearby hotels.",

        "news": "Around 100 more passengers were allowed to disembark from the coronavirus-stricken Diamond Princess cruise ship on Saturday, as Japan’s health minister apologised after 23 others were allowed to leave without being properly tested, AFP reports. The 100 passengers included the last group of Japanese passengers to leave the ship, while some foreign passengers were still waiting onboard for chartered aircraft to be sent by their governments. About 970 passengers disembarked earlier this week. Television footage showed a driver in a white protective suit at the wheel of a bus with the curtains drawn so that passengers could not be identified. They will be quarantined for two weeks near Tokyo, officials said. At a news conference, the health minister, Katsunobu Katō, apologised that 23 passengers had been allowed to disembark without undergoing all the required tests. \"We deeply regret that our operational mistake caused the situation,\" Katō said, adding that the passengers would be tested again. With the latest disembarkation, a 14-day quarantine is expected to start for more than 1,000 crew still onboard as many of them did not undergo isolation because they were needed to keep the ship running. They were preparing food and delivering meals to cabins, leading some critics to say they were inadvertently spreading the virus throughout the ship, which has seen more than 600 cases of the potentially deadly Covid-19 disease. Katō defended Japan’s onboard quarantine, telling a TV programme on Saturday that there was no medical facility large enough to admit more than 3,000 people at once.",

        "news": "The head of the World Health Organization (WHO) on Sunday called for global solidarity in the rollout of any future coronavirus vaccine, as the number of cases soared across the world. In a video address at the opening of the three-day World Health Summit in Berlin, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said the only way to recover from the pandemic was together and by making sure poorer countries had fair access to a vaccine. \"It is natural that countries want to protect their own citizens first but if and when we have an effective vaccine, we must also use it effectively. And the best way to do that is to vaccinate some people in all countries rather than all people in some countries,\" he said. \"Let me be clear: vaccine nationalism will prolong the pandemic, not shorten it.\" Scientists around the world are racing to develop a vaccine against Covid-19, which has killed over 1.1 million people globally. Several dozen vaccine candidates are currently being tested in clinical trials, ten of which are in the most advanced \"phase 3\" stage involving tens of thousands of volunteers, AFP reports. The European Union, the US, Britain, Japan and a slew of other nations have already placed large orders with the companies involved in developing the most promising vaccines. But concerns are growing that countries with smaller wallets could be left at the back of the queue. The WHO has launched an international scheme known as Covax to help ensure equitable access to jabs, but it has struggled to raise the funds needed.",

        "news": "Nearly one in four people may not get Covid-19 vaccines until at least 2022 because rich countries with less than 15% of the global population have reserved 51% of the doses of the most promising vaccines, researchers said. Low- and middle-income countries - home to more than 85% of the world’s population - would have to share the remainder, said researchers from the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health in the US. An effective response to the pandemic requires high-income countries \"to share in an equitable distribution of Covid-19 vaccines across the world\", they wrote. \"The uncertainty over global access to Covid-19 vaccines traces not only to ongoing clinical testing, but also from the failure of governments and vaccine manufacturers to be more transparent and accountable over these arrangements,\" they added. As of 15 November, high-income nations had pre-ordered nearly 7.5bn doses of vaccines from 13 manufacturers, the paper said. This included Japan, Australia and Canada who collectively have more than 1bn doses but accounted for less than 1% of current Covid-19 cases, it said. Even if leading manufacturers’ vaccines reach their projected maximum production capacity, nearly 25% of the world’s population may not get the vaccines for another year or more, according to the paper. The People’s Vaccine Alliance coalition last week said pharmaceutical companies should openly share their technology and intellectual property through the World Health Organization so that more doses can be manufactured. The John Hopkins researchers said WHO’s COVAX Facility could play a key role in ensuring fairer access to approved vaccines but it has only secured 500m doses, far below its target of delivering at least 2bn doses by the end of 2021. Launched in April, the global pact aims to pool funds from wealthier countries and nonprofits to accelerate the development and manufacture of Covid-19 vaccines and distribute them equitably around the world. It has so far secured half of the funding it needs and the US and Russia - key players in vaccine development and manufacture - have not joined, the Johns Hopkins study said.",

Don’t ask me, ask China that question, OK?\" He then called on CNN’s Kaitlan Collins, who ceded the mic to Jiang so she could ask her follow-up. Jiang, who is Asian-American, replied to Trump: \"Sir, why are you saying that to me, specifically, that I should ask China.\" \"I’m telling you, I’m not saying it specifically to anybody. I’m saying it to anybody that would ask a nasty question like that,\" he said. Collins then tried to ask her question but Trump skipped her.

The Guardian’s Julia Carrie Wong reports from San Francisco with Sam Levine in New York: Twitter for the first time took action against a series of tweets by Donald Trump, labeling them with a warning sign and providing a link to further information. Since ascending to the US presidency, Trump has used his Twitter account to threaten a world leader with war, amplify racist misinformation by British hate figures and, as recently as Tuesday morning, spread a lie about the 2001 death of a congressional aide in order to smear a cable news pundit. Throughout it all, Twitter has remained steadfast in its refusal to censor the head of state, even going so far as to write a new policy to allow itself to leave up tweets by \"world leaders\" that violate its rules. The company’s decision on Tuesday afternoon to affix labels to a series of Trump tweets about California’s election planning is a result of a new policy debuted on 11 May. They were applied – hours after the tweets initially went out – because Trump’s tweets violated Twitter’s \"civic integrity policy\", a company spokeswoman confirmed, which bars users from \"manipulating or interfering in elections or other civic processes\", such as by posting misleading information that could dissuade people from participating in an election.",

        "news": "The US Food and Drug Administration has revoked its emergency use authorisation for hydroxychloroquine to treat Covid-19, the drug championed by president Donald Trump. Based on new evidence, the FDA said it was no longer reasonable to believe that oral formulations of hydroxychloroquine and the related drug chloroquine may be effective in treating the illness caused by the coronavirus. The move comes after several studies of the decades-old malaria drug suggested it was not effective, including a widely anticipated trial earlier this month that showed it failed to prevent infection in people who had been exposed to the virus. The drug’s anti-inflammatory and antiviral properties suggested it might help treat Covid-19, and the FDA authorised its emergency use in March. While it did appear to neutralise the virus in laboratory experiments, hydroxychloroquine, which is also used to treat lupus and rheumatoid arthritis, has failed to prove its worth in human Covid-19 trials, thus far. In March, Trump said hydroxychloroquine used in combination with the antibiotic azithromycin had \"a real chance to be one of the biggest game changers in the history of medicine,\" with little evidence to back up that claim. He later said he took the drugs preventively after two people who worked at the White House were diagnosed with Covid-19, and he urged others to try it. Doctors in recent weeks had already pulled back on the use of hydroxychloroquine as a Covid-19 treatment, after several studies suggested it is not effective and may pose heart risks for certain patients. France, Italy and Belgium late last month moved to halt the use of hydroxychloroquine to treat Covid-19 patients. But the United States last month supplied Brazil with 2m doses for use against Covid-19, as the South American country has emerged as the pandemic’s latest epicenter. Meanwhile, some 400 trials are listed as using hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine as interventions for Covid-19, more than half of them still ongoing, according to a recent analysis from research firm GlobalData. In the United States, the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases last month launched a trial designed to show whether hydroxychloroquine in combination with azithromycin can prevent hospitalisation and death from Covid-19.",

The suspension will cover H-1B visas for skilled workers, H-2B visas for seasonal guest workers and other visa types, with an exception for workers in the food service industry, a senior official from the Trump administration said on Monday. President Donald Trump will also block L-1 visas for workers being transferred within a company through the end of the year, the official said, adding that the move would open up 525,000 jobs. Trump had previously hinted that he might extend a 60-day hold on green cards for foreign workers that he ordered to protect American jobs during the coronavirus outbreak. Analysts predict the number of green cards issued annually will drop from about 1 million to 300,000. The US dollar weakened and higher-risk currencies including the Australian dollar jumped on Monday as investors focused on the prospect for an eventual economic recovery from the coronavirus pandemic, Reuters reports.

Reuters has reported that the 86-year-old Iowa Republican has attended each of his party’s conventions since he was first elected to the Senate in 1980. His decision not to travel to Florida for this year’s event underscores broader concerns about holding mass gatherings as coronavirus cases there surge. \"I’m not going to go because of the virus situation,\" Grassley told reporters on Monday, according to a report in the Des Moines Register. The bulk of the Republican convention was moved from North Carolina after the state’s Democratic governor Roy Cooper would not commit to allowing a full convention because of pandemic concerns. Some 330 delegates will travel to Charlotte, North Carolina, from 22 to 24 August to nominate Trump as the Republican candidate to take on Democrat Joe Biden in the 3 November election. The more than 2,000 remaining delegates will perform a ceremonial vote between 24 and 27 August in Jacksonville, in Florida, to confirm the nomination, according to the Republican National Committee. The decision to relocate to Florida was made prior to the state’s recent spike in cases, which have grown from 667 new cases on 1 June to more than 10,000 new cases on Monday. The state has seen more than 200,000 total infections and 3,730 deaths as of Monday.

The US president Donald Trump had to give one year’s notice of for withdrawal from the Geneva-based UN agency under a 1948 joint resolution of the US Congress, which also obliges Washington to pay financial support. The United States currently owes the WHO more than $200m (approximately £160m) in assessed contributions, according to the WHO website. After more than 70 years of membership, the United States moved to quit the WHO after Trump accused it of becoming a puppet of China amid the pandemic. The virus first emerged in China’s Wuhan city late last year. Stéphane Dujarric, a UN spokesman, said: The secretary general ... is in the process of verifying with the World Health Organization whether all the conditions for such withdrawal are met. Trump had halted US funding for the 194-member organisation in April, then demanded a series of reforms on 18 May, before announcing the decision to pull the US out less than two weeks later. The WHO is an independent international body that works with the United Nations. The UN sSecretary general António Guterres has said the WHO is \"absolutely critical to the world’s efforts to win the war against Covid-19\". Trump has long scorned multilateralism as he focuses on an \"America First\" agenda. Since taking office, he has quit the UN Human Rights Council, the UN cultural agency, a global accord to tackle climate change and the Iran nuclear deal. He has also cut funding for the UN population fund and the UN agency that aids Palestinian refugees.",

        "news": "Several large US states including Texas are not heeding new federal health officials’ calls to reduce Covid-19 testing of some exposed to the virus, joining a broad rebuke of the Trump administration by public health leaders. Arizona, California, Connecticut, Florida, Illinois, Texas, New Jersey and New York all plan to continue to test asymptomatic people who have been exposed to Covid-19, despite new guidance from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) suggesting that such tests may not be needed. \"The current Texas guidance recommends testing for all close contacts of a confirmed case because it allows for early case identification among people who are at a higher risk of infection,\" a spokesman for the Texas Department of State Health Services in a statement. \"There’s not a planned change at this point.\" California and New York made similar statements. The Florida Department of Health said asymptomatic testing was continuing while the new CDC recommendations were evaluated, and Texas also said it would evaluate. The CDC said this week that people exposed to Covid-19 but not symptomatic may not need to be tested, shocking doctors and politicians, and prompting accusations the guidance was politically motivated. Even before the CDC guidance, coronavirus testing in the US had dropped. The US tested on average 675,000 people a day last week, down from a peak in late July of over 800,000 people a day. Nationally, cases have fallen for five weeks in a row but infections are surging again in the US Midwest with four states reporting record one-day increases in cases on Thursday as the US death toll climbed above 180,000. The CDC had previously recommended testing of all people who had close contact with someone who was diagnosed with Covid-19. New York governor Andrew Cuomo said the state of New York would not be abiding by the new guidance and challenged the assertion that politics played no role in the change. \"This 180-degree reversal of Covid-19 testing guidelines is reckless, and not based on science and has the potential to do long-term damage to the (CDC’s) reputation,\" Cuomo said in a joint statement, along with the governors of New Jersey and Connecticut, who also said their states would not be following the CDC’s guidance. Admiral Brett Giroir, the assistant secretary for health at the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), said there was no political pressure from the administration. He said that testing asymptomatic patients too early could produce false negatives and contribute to the virus’s spread. CNN and The New York Times reported on Wednesday that US public health officials were ordered by high-level members of the Trump administration to push forward with the changes. CDC director Robert Redfield issued a statement on Thursday that \"everyone who needs a Covid-19 test, can get a test,\" but \"everyone who wants a test does not necessarily need a test.\" Globally, many nations advocate early testing. The World Health Organization on Thursday said, that resources permitting, people exposed to the coronavirus should be tested even if they do not show immediate symptoms of infection. European governments have used broad testing and isolation to control the virus. France, for instance, recommends that anyone who thinks they need a test should get one and in Germany, people with close contact of 15 minutes or more with a person with Covid-19 are advised to have a test.",

        "news": "The Trump administration is planning to cut its membership dues to the World Health Organization, in a legally controversial move that will be challenged by Congress. The US issued its formal notice of withdrawal from the WHO in July, after Donald Trump accused the body of being pro-China and of failing to contain the coronavirus pandemic. However, the withdrawal does not take effect until next July, and until then – according to a 72-year-old agreement with Congress – the US is obliged to maintain its financial contributions. By the time of the withdrawal notice, the first tranche of $58m of its \"assessed contributions\" – national membership dues – had already been paid, leaving a second tranche of $65m due this month. That will now be diverted, according to a state department briefing to Congress. The notes said \"the US is reprogramming the balance of its planned Fiscal Year 2020 assessed WHO contributions to partially pay an assessment to the UN, earlier than it would have otherwise\".",

        "news": "AP: US Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden’s campaign is committing to releasing the results of all future Covid-19 tests the candidate takes. Biden spokesman Andrew Bates repeated on Saturday evening that the former vice president is tested regularly. But before President Donald Trump’s coronavirus diagnosis earlier this week Biden had not disclosed full details of his testing protocol or the results of each test. Biden told reporters on Saturday in Wilmington that he was not tested earlier in the day but would be tested Sunday morning. His campaign said he tested negative for Covid twice on Friday. Bates said in the statement that Biden was not in close contact with Trump, his family members or his aides during their debate Tuesday night. Several people in Trump’s orbit have tested positive in recent days. Biden’s campaign also emphasised in its latest statement that for months Biden and his campaign have followed public health guidelines on wearing masks and social distancing. At the same time, Trump has held large public rallies without requiring masks or enforcing social distancing.",

        "news": "The daily United States Covid-19 death toll has surpassed 3,000 for the first time, prompting pleas for Americans to scale back Christmas plans even with vaccines on the cusp of winning regulatory approval. Covid-19 deaths reached 3,253 on Wednesday, pushing up the US total since the start of the pandemic to 289,740. A record 106,219 people were hospitalised with the highly infectious disease, threatening to overwhelm many healthcare systems. Healthcare professionals and support staff, exhausted by demands of the pandemic, have been watching patients die alone as millions of Americans refuse to follow medical advice to wear masks and avoid crowds and smaller gatherings to contain the virus’ spread. In California’s San Joaquin Valley agricultural region, less than 2% of intensive care unit (ICU) beds remain unoccupied, the California Department of Public Health said on Thursday. The number of available ICU beds continued to drop throughout the most populous U.S. state, with just 7.7% availability in the heavily populated southern California region.Nursing home residents and staff have also felt the burden. \"This is a pandemic that no one has ever experienced in our lifetimes,\" Stephen Hanse, president of the New York State Health Facilities Association and the New York State Center for Assisted Living, told Reuters on Thursday. The one-day death toll exceeded the number of lives lost on 9/11, underscoring the human toll and the call for Americans to redouble efforts. \"No Christmas parties. There is not a safe Christmas party in this country right now,\" Dr. Michael Osterholm, a member of president-elect Joe Biden’s Covid-19 advisory board, told CNN on Thursday. It won’t end after that, but that is the period right now where we could have a surge upon a surge upon a surge. More than half of US states have recently introduced or resumed restrictions to try to curtail the rampant spread of the virus. On Thursday, Virginia’s governor Ralph Northam imposed a midnight-to-5 am curfew among other measures that will kick in on Monday and last through at least 31 January. \"Case numbers have been rising for weeks, they’re higher now than they’ve ever been during this entire pandemic, Northam told a news briefing. Providing a ray of hope, a vaccine could start reaching healthcare workers, first responders and nursing home residents within days in what Hanse called \"light at the end of the tunnel.\" A panel of independent medical experts was due to decide later on Thursday whether to recommend that the US Food and Drug Administration authorise emergency use of a vaccine from Pfizer Inc and German partner BioNTech SE. FDA consent could come as early as Friday or Saturday, followed by the first US injections on Sunday or Monday, Moncef Slaoui, chief adviser to the Trump administration’s Operation Warp Speed vaccine development program, told Fox News. A second vaccine developed by Moderna Inc will be reviewed by the advisory panel next week. Biden, who succeeds Donald Trump on 20 January, has set a goal of vaccinating 100 million people within the first 100 days of his administration.",

Dr Anthony Fauci also said he can’t guarantee\" that it will be safe for Americans to vote in person on Election Day, 3 November. Fauci said the process will be gradual and based on the status of the pandemic in various parts of the US, as well as the availability of rapid, widespread testing. \"Once the number of people who are seriously ill sharply declines, officials can begin to think about a gradual reentry of some sort of normality, some rolling reentry,\" Fauci said. In some places, he said, that might occur as soon as May. But whenever restrictions ease, Fauci said, \"we know that there will be people who will be getting infected.\"Social distancing guidelines imposed by President Donald Trump are set to expire 30 April. Trump is eager to restart the economy, which has stalled because most Americans are under orders to stay at home to help slow the virus spread. But other senior US public health officials have pushed back on Donald Trump’s eagerness to reopen the country quickly, as a senior World Health Organization (WHO) figure warned that Covid-19 \"is going to be a virus that stalks the human race for quite a long time to come\":",

Scientists believe the killer virus jumped from animals to humans, emerging in China late last year, possibly from a market in Wuhan selling exotic animals for meat. But US President Donald Trump, increasingly critical of China’s management of the first outbreak, claims to have proof it started in a Wuhan laboratory. And US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo on Sunday said \"enormous evidence\" backed up that claim, which China has vehemently denied. \"Like any evidence-based organisation, we would be very willing to receive any information that purports to the origin of the virus,\" Ryan said, stressing that this was \"a very important piece of public health information for future control. \"If that data and evidence is available, then it will be for the United States government to decide whether and when it can be shared, but it is difficult for the WHO to operate in an information vacuum in that regard,\" he added.",

Andrew Parker who was the director general of MI5 until two and half weeks ago, told a webinar: I’m just not aware of any evidence that it is anything other than what people think it is: It came via markets. There are all sorts of hypotheses around, but I just think it is not useful to speculate, worry about all that. The former British spy chief said it was the business of intelligence agencies to find out if there was ever a point when a state or non-state actor was trying to deliberately spread a dangerous disease. In that case, he said, there \"should be an expectation that the agencies will somehow uncover that\". But, in remarks that could have been addressed directly to the US president Donald Trump or the secretary of state Mike Pompeo, Parker concluded: Conspiracy theories right now are not helpful. Both Trump and Pompeo have publicly pushed the lab leak theory without offering supporting evidence. British intelligence agencies have been saying for the past couple of weeks they don’t subscribe to the lab leak theory, although the idea is nevertheless being pushed in news media in the UK, US and Australia.

The US has recorded more deaths from the disease than any other country in the pandemic, and almost three times as many as the second-ranking country, Britain, which has recorded more than 37,000 Covid-19 deaths. The latest count of fatalities is 100,047.

        "news": "Cancer patients with Covid-19 treated with a drug combination promoted by US President Donald Trump to counter coronavirus were three times more likely to die within 30 days than those who got either drug alone, U.S. researchers said. The preliminary results suggest doctors may want to refrain from prescribing the decades-old malaria treatment hydroxychloroquine with the antibiotic azithromycin for these patients until more study is done, researchers said. \"Treatment with hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin were strongly associated with increased risk of death,\" Dr. Howard Burris, president of the American Society of Clinical Oncology(ASCO), said in a briefing with reporters on the results. The drug combination initially was thought to help Covid-19 patients, but recent data has cast doubt. The preliminary findings, to be presented this week at ASCO’s virtual scientific meeting, show that the combination may pose a significant risk to cancer patients. \"Taking the combination gives a three times increased risk of dying within 30 days of any cause,\" Dr. Jeremy Warner of Vanderbilt University Medical System told reporters. Trump, who has often promoted hydroxychloroquine, in a March 21 tweet called the combination potentially \"one of the biggest game changers in the history of medicine.\" That was based on a study of fewer than 40 patients in the International Journal of Antimicrobial Agents. More recent studies have shown little or no benefit and increased risks. Warner and colleagues analysed data on 925 patients with cancer who became infected with the coronavirus between March and April. Thirteen percent of the patients died within 30 days of their diagnosis. Overall, patients whose cancers were actively progressing at the time of infection were five times more likely to die within 30 days than those who were in remission or had no current evidence of cancer. In the trial, 180 patients were taking hydroxychloroquine in combination with azithromycin, and 90 were taking hydroxychloroquine alone. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has allowed healthcare providers to prescribe the drugs for Covid-19 through an emergency-use authorisation, but has not approved the treatment. The governments of France, Italy and Belgium moved on Wednesday to halt the use of hydroxychloroquine for Covid-19 patients following a World Health Organization decision on Monday to pause a large trial of the drug due to safety concerns.",

The man had not visited China but a Chinese work colleague who was in Germany last week had started to feel sick on the flight home on 23 January, said Andreas Zapf, the head of the Bavarian state office for health and food safety. He had attended a training session given by his Chinese colleague on 21 January at the office of a car parts supplier Webasto in Stockdorf in Bavaria and tested positive for the virus on Monday evening. Unlike the other patients, the 33-year-old had not recently travelled to China. He remains in hospital in an isolation ward, but Zapf said he \"was doing well\". The Chinese woman immediately sought medical attention on her return to China and was confirmed to have caught the virus, which has spread rapidly in recent weeks after first emerging in the city of Wuhan. The woman had recently returned from visiting her parents in the Wuhan region, Zapf said. In a statement, the Webasto company said it had halted all business travel to and from China \"for at least the next two weeks\".

We’re getting a little more now from the press conference (given online, not in person) by the Chinese foreign ministry. The government has been at pains to emphasise that it has the tools to control the spread of this coronavirus outbreak, but this morning did concede it needs help – in the form of protective medical equipment. \"What China urgently needs at present are medical masks, protective suits and safety goggles,\" the foreign ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying said in a press briefing on Monday morning. China’s factories can produce 20 million masks a day, but panic over the virus has prompted people in the country of 1.4 billion to stock up on them, while frontline medical personnel have reported equipment shortages. Agence France-Presse provides this context: At full capacity, China’s factories are only able to produce around 20m masks a day, according to the ministry of industry. The foreign ministry said countries including South Korea, Japan, Kazakhstan and Hungary had donated medical supplies. Tian Yulong, of the industry ministry, said earlier on Monday that authorities were taking steps to bring in masks from Europe, Japan and the US, adding that supply and demand in China remained in \"tight equilibrium\" as factories returned to production after the lunar new year break. He said they were now operating at between 60% and 70% capacity. In addition to Hubei, the province of more than 50 million people at the centre of the outbreak, several other provinces and cities across China have made it compulsory to wear masks in public. These include Guangdong – China’s most populous province – plus Sichuan, Jiangxi, Liaoning and the city of Nanjing, with a combined population of more than 300 million.",

The data confirm our view that capex growth this year will be soft, and is very likely to miss the RBA’s forecast – as the survey was done in Q4 it does not include any additional drag from the coronavirus outbreak. We continue to expect further monetary easing, and the pressure will mount on the government to loosen policy in its May budget.

The Istituto Nazionale della Previdenza Sociale (INPS), the largest social security and welfare institute in Italy, said in a new study that the official death figures were not \"reliable\", according to AFP. Its study showed that 156,42 total deaths were recorded in Italy in March and April, which is 46,909 higher than the average number of fatalities in those months recorded between 2015 and 2019. But only 27,938 deaths linked to coronavirus were reported during that period by the Civil Protection Agency, whose toll forms the basis of national statistics, the INPS said. That meant there were 18,971 excess deaths during this period, with the vast majority of 18,412 recorded in the coronavirus-ravaged north of the country. \"Given the fact that the number of deaths is quite stable in these times, we can - with necessary caution - attribute a large portion of these deaths during these past two months to the epidemic,\" the INPS said. It added that the increase in deaths was likely not only due to the disease, but from people suffering from other illnesses unable to get healthcare due to hospitals being overwhelmed by the coronavirus pandemic. As of Friday, the pandemic has claimed 32,486 deaths in Italy, of which 26,715 have been in Lombardy alone, Europe’s worst affected region.",

        "news": "The British prime minister Boris Johnson has played down the prospect of a second national coronavirus lockdown, saying he did not want to use it any more than Britain’s Trident nuclear deterrent. Johnson said the authorities were getting better at identifying and isolating local outbreaks, although it was important that the power to order national action was held in reserve. \"I can’t abandon that tool any more than I would abandon a nuclear deterrent. But it is like a nuclear deterrent, I certainly don’t want to use it. And nor do I think we will be in that position again,\" he told the Sunday Telegraph. His comments could lead to further tensions between ministers and their scientific experts after the chief scientific adviser, Sir Patrick Vallance, warned on Friday there was \"a risk\" that national measures could be needed as winter approaches. Announcing another easing of lockdown restrictions in England, Johnson on Friday said he hoped there could be a \"significant return to normality\" in time for Christmas. At the same time, he said the government had given local authorities new powers to close specific premises, shut outdoor spaces and cancel events. Johnson told the Telegraph: \"It’s not just that we’re getting much better at spotting the disease and isolating it locally, but we understand far more which groups it affects, how it works, how it’s transmitted, so the possibility of different types of segmentation, of enhanced shielding for particular groups, is now there. \"We’re genuinely able now to look at what’s happening in much closer to real time, to isolate outbreaks and to address them on the spot, and to work with local authorities to contain the problem locally and regionally if we have to.\" As he approaches his first anniversary in office, Johnson insisted his agenda for domestic reform and \"levelling up\" the economy would not be blown off course by the pandemic. \"We want to be a transformative government, because there’s a massive opportunity in this country to do things differently and to do things better,\" he said. \"We’ve seen that really exemplified in what happened with coronavirus.\" The official coronavirus death toll in the UK stands currently at 45,053, the highest in Europe and the third highest worldwide. The Office for National Statistics has recorded 64,500 excess deaths in the country during the pandemic, suggesting the real number of fatalities is likely higher than the official tally.",

        "title": "Ireland tightens restrictions as cases surge at fourth highest rate in Europe",
        "news": "Ireland significantly tightened its nationwide coronavirus restrictions on Tuesday to rein in an increase in cases, urging everyone to restrict visitors to their homes, avoid public transport and for older people to limit their contacts. A surge in cases over the last three weeks after Ireland had one of Europe’s lowest infection rates for several weeks, pushed the country’s 14-day cumulative cases per 100,000 population to 26 and led to the first local lockdown last week. The 190 new cases on Tuesday, the second highest daily rise since early May, took the rate of growth in the last two weeks to the fourth highest in Europe and meant infections would inevitably spread to the most vulnerable if it continued, the prime minister Micheal Martin said. \"We’re absolutely not at a stage where we can return to normality. We are at another critical moment,\" the Taoiseach told a news conference, saying the new measures would stay in place until 13 September. Ireland has adopted one of the most cautious approaches in Europe in fighting the virus, reopening its economy at a slower pace and keeping many restrictions in place for longer. The government has already twice-delayed the final phase of its reopening plan that would allow nightclubs and all pubs to open, having sped up the plan in June when cases began to fall. As well as cutting to six the number of visitors allowed in a home - where most clusters have occurred - outdoor gatherings are being restricted to 15 people from 200, with all fans banned from sport. Police will get greater powers to enforce the rules. Restaurants and pubs that serve food can stay open. Martin said the aim of the restrictions was to make sure key parts of the economy kept trading and schools could reopen for the first time since March. \"Schools are so important to children in general, to society, to the economy as well, that we want our schools to reopen, and our schools will reopen,\" Martin said.",

        "news": "France registered 3,776 new Covid-19 infections on Wednesday, marking another post-lockdown peak and bringing the total to 225,043, but president Emmanuel Macron again ruled out imposing another national lockdown. \"All the indicators keep going up and the transmission of the virus is getting stronger among all ages groups affected, young adults in particular\", the health ministry said in a statement. It said the virus was especially active in and around Paris and Marseille, the country’s two biggest cities. Some medical experts are worried about the impact of Paris St Germain fans’ wild, mask-less celebrations on the Champs Elysees avenue in central Paris after their soccer club reached the Champions League final on Tuesday. Paris municipal officials are also concerned about large gatherings of fans expected on Sunday, when Paris St Germain will play the final either against Olympique Lyonnais, another French club, or Germany’s Bayern Munich. Despite the surge in infections, Macron told Paris Match magazine in an interview that \"local strategies\" were preferable to another national lockdown, which he said would cause considerable \"collateral damage\". The seven-day moving average of the case tally, which smooths out daily reporting irregularities, is now at 2,621, above the 2,500 threshold for the first time since 19 April, when France was enforcing one of Europe’s strictest lockdowns. The number of people in hospital fell again by 17 to 4,806 and those in intensive care slipped by six to 374, reflecting the preponderance of younger people among the new cases who are more likely to be asymptomatic or not to fall seriously ill. Both numbers had been on an uninterrupted downward trend since early April, but that trend has slowed in the past two weeks. The number of deaths increased by 17 to 30,468, following an increase of 22 on Tuesday and of 19 on Monday.",

        "news": "Sweden has chosen the right strategy in fighting the spread of the new coronavirus, prime minister Stefan Lofven said, defending his government’s decision not to adopt a strict lockdown as many European countries have done. More than 5,800 Swedes have died of Covid-19, a much higher death rate than Norway, Denmark and Finland which adopted much tougher measures, leading many to question the government’s approach. But Lofven said Sweden made the correct choice. \"The strategy that we adopted, I believe is right - to protect individuals, limit the spread of the infection, etc,\" he said in an interview in daily Dagens Nyheter. \"What has been discussed most, and what we did differently in Sweden, was that we did not close schools. Now there are quite a few people who think we were right.\" Whereas many countries enforced strict lockdowns, Sweden has relied mainly on voluntary measures focused on social distancing, though public gatherings have been limited and care homes - which saw a heavy death toll - quarantined. While Sweden has seen more fatalities than its neighbours, it has not been as badly hit as countries like Britain and Spain, which adopted much stricter lockdown measures. And many parts of Europe are seeing a pick up in new cases as they gradually loosen restrictions on travel and social interactions, Sweden has seen a decline in both infections and deaths in recent weeks. Lofven also defended the decision by the Public Health Agency not to enforce the wearing of facemasks, as many European countries have done, to fight the spread of the virus. \"What they are saying, and what I absolutely believe, is that they cannot be the main tool we use,\" Lofven said. \"What is important still is social distancing, testing and tracking. Those must be our main focus in order to reduce infection.\"",

        "news": "Latin America has started to resume normal social and public life at a time when the Covid-19 pandemic still requires major control interventions, World Health Organization regional director Carissa Etienne said on Wednesday. Coronavirus cases in Colombia’s border area with Venezuela have increased ten-fold in the last two weeks, Etienne said in a virtual briefing from Washington with other Pan American Health Organization directors. Death rates are climbing in parts of Mexico, and similar trends are seen in Ecuador, Costa Rica and Bolivia, with similar patterns also emerging in areas of Argentina, she warned. Although the entire world is racing to develop new tools to prevent and cure Covid-19, a safe and effective vaccine that can be manufactured and delivered at scale is not around the corner. We must be clear that opening up too early gives this virus more room to spread and puts our populations at greater risk. Look no further than Europe. Etienne said governments must monitor travel very carefully because reopening to tourism can lead to setbacks. That has happened in the Caribbean, where several countries that had virtually no cases have experienced spikes as tourism resumed. According to a Reuters tally, Latin America has recorded around 8.4 million coronavirus cases, and over 314,000 deaths, both figures being the highest of any region.",

Later Reuters reported the French government would not be joining WHO’s international vaccine programme, a blow to the UN body’s effort to discourage \"vaccine nationalism\". •Canada could lose its ability to manage the coronavirus pandemic owing to a worrying recent surge in Covid-19 cases, the country’s top medical officer has said. The warning from the chief public health officer, Theresa Tam, is the clearest indication yet of how worried authorities in the country are about the potential for the outbreak to spiral out of control. •Facebook said it would no longer show health groups in its recommendations to ensure users get health information from authoritative sources. It said the move reflected its view that such sources of information were \"crucial\". •In the US, New York City once again delayed the return of most of the million-plus students in its public schools. The mayor, Bill de Blasio, said most elementary school students would do remote-only learning until 29 September. •Wuhan, ground zero for the coronavirus outbreak, has reopened for international flights, ending an eight-month moratorium since the disease first emerged. China stopped international flights in March as global alarm increased about the spread of Covid-19, but has now largely brought the disease under control. •The World Health Organization warned of \"alarming rates of transmission\" of Covid-19 across Europe and cautioned countries against shortening quarantine periods. The body said the number of coronavirus cases in September \"should serve as a wake-up call for all of us\". That’s all from me. Lucy Campbell will pick up the baton shortly.",

        "news": "A \"no-deal\" Brexit could be three times more costly to Britain’s economy in the long term than the coronavirus outbreak, a new study published on Tuesday has warned. The thinktank UK in a Changing Europe said the political and economic effects of the pandemic were likely to mitigate or hide that of failing to secure a trade agreement with the EU. But in the short term, the lack of a new formal trading relationship with Brussels would be bad news for economic recovery, and its impact larger than that of the health crisis in the long term. The thinktank, which collaborated with the London School of Economics (LSE), said Brexit would hit growth in the coming years more than if the UK had opted to remain in the bloc. Its authors wrote: The claim that the economic impacts of Covid-19 dwarf those of Brexit is almost certainly correct in the short term. Not even the most pessimistic scenarios suggest that a no-deal Brexit would lead to a fall in output comparable to that seen in the second quarter of 2020. However - assuming a reasonably strong recovery, and that government policies succeed in avoiding persistent mass unemployment - in the long run, Brexit is likely to be more significant. Our modelling with LSE of the impact of a no-deal Brexit suggests that the total cost to the UK economy over the longer term will be two to three times as large as that implied by the Bank of England’s forecast for the impact of Covid-19. The study estimated that the negative impact on gross domestic product would be 5.7% over the next 15 years compared with the current level, while GDP was forecast to take a 2.1% hit from Covid-19. The projections come despite a lack of clarity about the overall repercussions from the pandemic, and as a second wave of infections hits Europe.",

        "news": "Some more detail on news the Dutch government has tightened some of Europe’s most relaxed coronavirus rules after a surge in cases, ordering bars to shut early and recommending people wear masks in shops. The prime minister, Mark Rutte, told a news conference that the situation in the country’s three largest cities, Amsterdam, Rotterdam and The Hague, had become \"serious\" and required urgent action. \"We’re doing our best, but the virus is doing better,\" said the country’s health minister, Hugo de Jonge, adding that nearly 3,000 new infections were being recorded a day, with the figure expected to reach 5,000 within weeks. The Netherlands has so far avoided the harsh measures introduced by its European neighbours, preferring a so-called \"intelligent lockdown\" and refusing to order the wearing of masks. But people were now advised to wear masks while shopping in the three big cities, with retailers allowed to refuse entry to those who did not, Rutte said. However, Rutte said that masks - which are already compulsory on public transport – \"won’t do the big trick\" and had not worked in France or Spain by themselves. Restaurants and bars must now close at 10pm, while people may only have four people to visit over the age of 13, Rutte said. Sports matches will be played behind closed doors again, including top-tier Eredivisie football, which had only just begun its new season with a limited number of spectators. Rutte had warned fans recently to \"keep their mouths shut\" after many had defied a ban on chanting. Working from home should once again become standard, de Jonge said.",

The city’s borders will also be closed to outsiders for non-necessary visits under the new measures for large municipalities with high coronavirus infection rates. Another nine cities in the metropolitan area will also be affected. \"Madrid’s health is Spain’s health. Madrid is special,\" health minister Salvador Illa told a news conference to announce the new regulations, which are due to come into force in the coming days. He did not say exactly when. People will be allowed to cross municipal boundaries to go to work or school, visit the doctor or go shopping, but must remain within the city for leisure activities, according to the agreement. Other measures include the closure of bars and restaurants at 11pm, from a previous curfew of 1am, as well as the closure of public parks and playgrounds. Social gatherings will be limited to six people. Currently a hotbed for infection, the Madrid region accounts for more than a third of the 133,604 cases diagnosed in Spain over the past two weeks. Madrid has 735 cases per 100,000 people, one of the highest of any region in Europe and double the national rate The conservative regional assembly had already enforced localised lockdowns in 45, mostly poor districts, often with a high immigrant population. But the new wider restrictions see the central government overriding the regional government after weeks of fighting between the two authorities over what should be done in the capital city. This has taken the political polarisation that has characterised much of the response to the pandemic over the past months to new heights, exasperating inhabitants. Spain has recorded a total of 769,188 cases, more than any other nation in western Europe. The total death toll stands at 31,791. \"We must be conscious that there are tough weeks, very tough, ahead,\" Illa said.",

The decree was approved at a cabinet meeting after a steady increase in cases over the last two months. It will probably be effective from Thursday, a government source said. Several Italian regions including Lazio, around the capital Rome, had already made face masks mandatory. Data from the health ministry showed 3,678 cases were reported in the last 24 hours, up from 2,677 on Tuesday and surging past the 3,000 mark for the first time since 24 April. Italy is still recording far fewer daily cases than other large European countries such as France, Spain and the UK. As a part of Rome’s effort to curb the spread of the virus, the health minister Roberto Speranza on Wednesday ordered compulsory testing on travellers from the United Kingdom, Belgium, the Netherlands and Czech Republic [see 8.35pm]. Italy was the first country in Europe to be hard-hit by Covid-19 and has the second highest death toll in the continent after the UK, with 36,061 deaths recorded since the outbreak began in February, according to official figures. Thanks to one of the strictest lockdowns in the world, the government managed to get the virus under control by the summer but infections are now rising fast. However, daily Covid-related deaths remain far lower than during the first wave of Italy’s epidemic six months ago. Some 31 people died on Wednesday, the health ministry said, while 24 April, the last day with more than 3,000 cases, saw 420 deaths. The cabinet on Wednesday also approved a decree to extend the Covid-19 state of emergency to 31 January. The state of emergency, originally due to expire in mid-October, gives greater powers to central government, making it easier for officials to bypass the bureaucracy that smothers much decision-making in Italy.",

The government will hold an extraordinary cabinet meeting on Friday morning to decree the state of emergency if Madrid does not impose the restrictions or request intervention, the government said. Following a health ministry order, Madrid authorities reluctantly barred all non-essential travel to and from the city and nine surrounding towns last Friday to curb the spread of Covid-19 in one of Europe’s worst virus hotspots. A Madrid regional court on Thursday annulled the measures ordered by the national health ministry, ruling the government had overstepped its mandate and the restrictions interfered with fundamental human rights. Declaring a state of emergency - the same legal framework that underpinned Spain’s tough lockdown during the first wave of the virus - would grant the national government the powers to restrict movement. According to a government statement, the prime Minister Pedro Sanchez told Madrid’s regional leader Isabel Diaz Ayuso that she must either enforce the restrictions, request a state of emergency or the central government would unilaterally impose one. The government said: In any of the three cases the measures would be exactly the same as those already being applied, the only thing that would change would be the legal instrument. Ayuso said regional officials would discuss alternatives on Friday morning. She said in a statement: We hope to agree on a solution that benefits citizens and provides clarity.",

        "news": "Global coronavirus cases rose by more than 400,000 for the first time late on Friday, a record one-day increase as much of Europe enacts new restrictions to curb the outbreak. Europe, which successfully damped down the first surge of infections, has emerged as the new coronavirus epicentre in recent weeks and is reporting on average 140,000 cases a day over the past week. As a region, Europe is reporting more daily cases than India, Brazil and the US combined. Of every 100 infections reported around the world, 34 were from European countries, according to a Reuters analysis. The region is currently reporting a million new infections about every nine days and has reported more than 6.3 million cases since the pandemic began. Major European countries - the UK, France, Russia, the Netherlands and Spain - accounted for about half of Europe’s new cases in the week to 18 October. France is reporting the highest seven-day average of new cases in Europe with 19,425 infections per day followed by the United Kingdom, Russia, Spain and the Netherlands in the list of worst affected European countries. Several European countries are closing schools, cancelling elective surgeries and enlisting student medics as the authorities face a Covid-19 resurgence. Russia is moving students to online learning and Northern Ireland is closing schools for two weeks and restaurants for four. In Spain, authorities in Catalonia ordered bars and restaurants to close for 15 days and limited the numbers of people allowed in shops. The Czech Republic has also shifted schools to distance learning and plans to call up thousands of medical students. Hospitals are cutting non-urgent medical procedures to free up beds. Polish health officials have warned the country is on the brink of a disaster as a record 6,526 new coronavirus infections and 116 deaths were reported this week. Poland is ramping up training for nurses and considering creating military field hospitals. Latin America is the worst-affected region with about 27% of total Covid-19 cases followed by Asia, North America and Europe. India is reporting fewer cases this month compared with September, with 69,000 cases per day. The numbers have fallen by more than 20,400 over the last three weeks, down 22% from its previous peak. India reported 55,342 cases on 13 October, its lowest daily increase since 18 August. In the US, which has the largest total number of cases and deaths in the world, new infections are edging higher along with the most hospitalised Covid-19 patients since early September.",

        "title": "Mounting pressure on Portugal's health system could prompt further restrictions, minister says",
        "news": "Portugal’s health minister has said the country’s national health service is under grave pressure and further restrictive measures could be coming as the number of patients in intensive care approach record levels. \"Although the Portuguese and the national health service are better prepared to respond to the pandemic than before, the situation in Portugal - as in other places - is grave,\" health minister Marta Temido said. The government \"is ready to cover possible new municipalities with more restrictive measures,\" she added. Three municipalities in the country’s north went into partial lockdown last Thursday, and non-essential travel between regions was banned from 30 October to 3 November to reduce the risk of transmission during the All Saints national holiday. A total of 1,672 people were in hospital as of Monday, with 240 in intensive care units (ICUs) - close to the peak of 271 reached in April. The health system, which prior to the pandemic had the lowest number of critical care beds per 100,000 inhabitants in Europe, could accommodate a maximum of 800 Covid-19 patients in ICUs, Temido said. Given current trends, over half that figure would be reached by next week, the minister cautioned. Portugal has reported a total of 121,133 coronavirus cases and 2,343 deaths. Recent numbers of new daily cases - reaching 3,669 on Saturday - have approached triple the country’s previous peak in April, but testing has also multiplied by around the same proportion. The country’s toll of hospitalisations and deaths has surpassed April levels, reflecting the considerable number of new cases still being detected among higher-risk age groups, worrying health authorities. Rising hospitalisations and deaths are not linked to increased testing. Parliament voted on Friday for masks to be compulsory in public spaces where social distancing is difficult for a period of 70 days, a measure which will soon come into law.",

        "news": "Nearly 200 airports across the UK and Europe are at risk of going bust within months due to the dramatic collapse in air travel caused by the coronavirus pandemic, the European airports trade body has warned. Airports Council International Europe (ACI Europe), which represents airport operators, said it estimated that 193 out of Europe’s 740 commercial airports face \"insolvency in the coming months if passenger traffic does not start to recover by the year-end\". The trade body said the at-risk airports employed 277,000 people and generated collective annual revenues of €12.4bn (£11.2bn). Olivier Jankovec, the director general of ACI Europe, said the figures \"paint a dramatically bleak picture\" for the future of the aviation industry, which has already suffered tens of thousands of job losses. Eight months into the crisis, all of Europe’s airports are burning through cash to remain open, with revenues far from covering the costs of operations, let alone capital costs. Governments’ current imposition of quarantines rather than testing is bringing Europe’s airports closer to the brink with every day that passes.",

She said the Commission made available €220m to finance the transfer of Covid-19 patients across EU countries to avoid healthcare systems in the most affected countries not being able to cope. At the meeting leaders agreed to better coordinate efforts to battle the virus as infections in Europe exceeded 10 million, making the continent again the centre of the pandemic. EU countries want to avoid divisions which dogged the 27-nation bloc at the beginning of the pandemic, when nations vied with each other to buy scarce medical equipment. To better trace infections, von der Leyen said the EU would work for the quick validation at EU level of rapid antigen tests, which allow quicker results than the standard PCR (polymerase chain reaction) molecular kits.",

        "news": "Four Italian regions will go into partial lockdown from Friday as the government scrambles to regain control of the coronavirus pandemic. Giuseppe Conte’s government is trying to avoid a full national shutdown and has instead introduced a three-tier system that divides the country’s 20 regions up according to level of risk. The northern regions of Lombardy, Piedmont and Aosta Valley, along with Calabria in the south, have been placed in the \"red zone\", meaning people will only be able to leave their homes for work, health or emergency reasons and bars, restaurants and non-essential shops – apart from hairdressers – will close. People will be banned from travelling in or out of their regions. In Puglia and Sicilia, which have been placed in the orange zone, bars and restaurants will be closed and people will be able to move freely within their towns and cities but not leave them. The rest of the country will be in the yellow zone, meaning there will be no new restrictions apart from those already imposed nationally, such as the 6pm closure of bars and restaurants and complete closure of cinemas, theatres and gyms. All regions will be under a 10pm-5am curfew. Unlike in the spring, factories will stay open across the country. Restrictions per region have been determined by the rate of Covid-19 transmission, the number of infections and people with symptoms and the availability of hospital beds. The measures will be in place until 3 December. \"The virus here, and in the whole of Europe, is racing strongly, and violently,\" Conte said. Cases last week doubled compared to the previous one, the rate of transmission has increased to 1.7 nationally, and in some regions it’s higher. There are no alternatives, to slow the curve we need these restrictions … I understand the inconvenience and frustration, but we have to hold tight. Conte said intensive care capacity would be at risk in 15 of Italy’s 20 regions within a few weeks unless new measures were enacted. Italy registered 30,550 new coronavirus cases on Wednesday and 352 fatalities. The number of people hospitalised across the country stood at 22,116 Wednesday, of whom 2,292 were in intensive care – more than double the number on 24 October. Doctors had called for more aggressive restrictions as hospitals become overwhelmed and staff fall sick – 14,000 health workers were infected with coronavirus between September and October, and 184 medics have died since the start of the pandemic. The worst-affected regions in terms of daily caseload are Lombardy, which on Wednesday registered 7,758 cases, Campania, which for now is in the yellow zone, and Piedmont.",

        "news": "A dozen US states reported record one-day increases in Covid-19 cases on Thursday, a day after the country set a record with nearly 105,000 new infections reported on Wednesday, according to a Reuters tally. The outbreak is spreading in every region of the country but is hitting the Midwest the hardest, based on new cases per capita. Illinois reported nearly 10,000 new cases and along with Texas is leading the nation in the most cases reported in the last seven days. Other Midwestern states with record increases in cases on Thursday were Indiana, Iowa, Minnesota, Missouri, North Dakota and Ohio. Arkansas, Maine, Oklahoma, Rhode Island, Utah and West Virginia also set records for rises in new infections. Some cities and states have announced new measures such as curfews or reduced gathering sizes to combat the spread of the virus, but the United States has taken no action at the federal level. Seventeen out of 50 states do not require masks. Many countries in Europe are shutting high-risk businesses and even ordering national or regional lockdowns as a second wave sweeps over the continent. In addition to rising cases, US hospitalisations of patients with Covid-19 rose to over 52,500 on Thursday, up for an 11th day in a row and getting closer to the record of 58,370 set in July. North Dakota reported only eight free intensive care unit beds in the entire state on Thursday. Hospitalisation are a key metric because they are not affected by the amount of testing done. Coronavirus deaths are trending higher but not at the same rate as cases. The United States is averaging 850 deaths a day, up from 700 a month ago. In recent days, six states have reported their highest one-day increases in deaths ever: Arkansas, Idaho, North Dakota, South Dakota, West Virginia and Wyoming.

        "news": "Cyprus on Wednesday announced partial lockdowns in its virus hotspots on the Mediterranean coast and other measures in an effort to curb a surge in coronavirus cases. The resort towns of Limassol and Paphos on the south coast are to go into partial lockdown from Thursday until the end of November. The health minister Constantinos Ioannou said that travel into or out of the towns would be banned, and a curfew in force from 8pm to 5am. After keeping daily infection numbers low through most of the summer, the island has seen them rise to record three-digit figures and the health system has started to feel the strain, with a dedicated Covid-19 hospital at capacity. Whereas at the end of June it had a total of 1,000 coronavirus cases, the figure has shot up to almost 6,500 in the second wave that is now gripping Europe. Forty-nine of 68 patients in hospital with Covid-19 are from Limassol and Paphos, as well seven of the last eight deaths from the coronavirus. Hospitality and catering venues are to close in the two towns, and gatherings banned in public places like parks. Primary schools will remain open, while higher and secondary education will operate remotely. Museums, cinemas and theatres will shut until 30 November in Limassol and Paphos, and attending church is prohibited. Shopping malls, department stores, hair salons, gyms and beauty parlours will also have to close. In the rest of Cyprus, a curfew remains in place until 30 November from 11pm to 5am, while bars, cafes and restaurants have to close by 10.30pm. The Republic of Cyprus, which registered 165 new virus cases on Wednesday, has officially recorded 6,461 infections and 33 deaths. The island had largely kept a lid on the pandemic by introducing an early lockdown in March that was gradually eased from early May. Authorities are keen to avoid another draconian lockdown, with the economy already in recession. Health authorities blame the surge on Cypriots flouting hygiene rules, including on mask-wearing and social distancing. Face masks are mandatory indoors and outdoors, except at home, while household gatherings are limited to 10 people. The breakaway Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus, which is recognised only by Ankara, has registered 986 coronavirus cases, including five deaths.",

        "news": "Germany will extend its current coronavirus restrictions through to early January unless there is a dramatic drop in infections - something that is not expected, chancellor Angela Merkel said. Speaking after a meeting with the heads of Germany’s 16 states, Merkel said the measures introduced in early November, including limits on private gatherings and the closure of restaurants, leisure and cultural facilities, cannot be lifted given current infection rates. The curbs will be continued \"until 20 December first but we assume that ... due to the very high incidence of infection, restrictions will have to apply until the beginning of January unless we have an unexpected decrease,\" Merkel said. The agreement means continued closures for restaurants, bars, sporting facilities and cultural venues in Europe’s biggest economy, though schools and shops will remain open. From 1 December, private gatherings will be limited to five people from two households - down from 10 people currently, though children are exempted from the new rule. Trains will also expand their seating capacity, in order to better ensure distancing between passengers. Fireworks will be banned on certain public squares to prevent people from gathering in large groups on New Year’s Eve in particular. Germany will also seek a deal with European partners to close ski slopes through to early January, to prevent the virus spreading further. \"I will say this openly that it won’t be easy, but we will try,\" Merkel said. The measures were agreed after more than seven hours of tense talks, with some less-affected regions calling for lighter restrictions. The number of new infections in Germany has plateaued over the past two weeks, with October’s exponential growth brought to a halt. However, health officials have sounded the alarm over rapidly filling intensive care units and an inability to track the source of transmission while rates remain high. In order to ease restrictions, the infection rate would have to come down to below 50 new cases per 100,000 inhabitants per week, Merkel said - a far cry from the current seven-day incidence of almost 140. \"The steeply rising curve has become a flat one, but this is only a partial success. We can by no means be satisfied with this partial success,\" she said. Germany has registered a total of 961,320 coronavirus cases and 14,771 deaths, according to the Robert Koch Institute disease control centre. Wednesday saw 18,633 new cases and a record 410 deaths.",

        "news": "The head of British drug manufacturer AstraZeneca said further research was needed on its Covid-19 vaccine after questions emerged over the protection it offers, but the additional testing is unlikely to affect regulatory approval in Europe. AstraZeneca and its partner, the University of Oxford, announced on Monday that it was seeking regulatory approval for the vaccine after it showed an average 70% effectiveness. That rate jumped to 90% when an initial half-dose then a full dose was given, similar to that of rival vaccines in development by Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna. But it emerged the higher rate of effectiveness came during tests in people aged 55 and under, and was discovered by accident during the clinical trials. The head of the Oxford Vaccine Group, Andrew Pollard, said this week that further evidence will be available next month, but the result was still \"highly significant\". \"Now that we’ve found what looks like a better efficacy, we have to validate this, so we need to do an additional study,\" AstraZeneca chief executive Pascal Soriot told Bloomberg. He said he expected there would be another \"international study but this one could be faster because we know the efficacy is high, so we need a smaller number of patients\". The additional trial was not likely to delay regulatory approval in Britain and the EU, Soriot said. There are high hopes for the AstraZeneca/Oxford vaccine, which Pollard has hailed as a \"vaccine for the world\" given that it could be cheaper to make, and easier to store and distribute. It can be stored, transported and handled at normal refrigerated conditions of between two and eight degrees Celsius (36-46 Fahrenheit) for at least six months. Pfizer/BioNTech’s offering requires temperatures of -70C, driving up costs and potentially making it out of reach for lower and middle-income countries. AstraZeneca/Oxford has also promised to provide its vaccine to the developing world on a non-profit basis.",

The agreement, which applies to celebrations on Christmas Eve, Christmas, New Year’s Eve and on New Year’s Day, means a slight relaxation of the current general rule that allows gatherings of up to six people, except in some regions that have defined their own limits. The start of the night-time curfews in force in most Spanish regions would be moved to 1:30am from 11pm on 24 and 31 December. Still, movement of people between regions will be banned, with some exceptions, between 23 December and 6 January, Illa told a news conference, adding that although the latest infection data inspired some optimism, prudence was paramount. To sum it up, this Christmas we stay at home ... It is desirable that people restrict their mobility and social contacts as much as possible. Governments across Europe are trying to navigate between avoiding spreading the virus over the holiday season and allowing people to celebrate with family and friends. The 10-person limit includes children, and the official recommendation is for people from the same household to celebrate together without outside guests. Spain imposed a six-month state of emergency in October, giving regions legal backing to impose curfews and other restrictions. While the rate of infection in the country has slowed since, its overall tally of over 1.66m Covid-19 cases is among the highest in western Europe. The death toll reached 45,784 on Wednesday.",

        "news": "Italy on Saturday became the European country with the highest official number of Covid fatalities, as its new total of 64,036 deaths overtook Britain, according to an Agence France-Presse tally. The Italian health ministry said that 649 people had died from the virus in the previous 24 hours and that 19,903 new cases had been diagnosed. Worldwide, the US has reported the highest number of Covid-19 deaths, with 295,539 as of Saturday morning, followed by Brazil, India and Mexico. According to the AFP tally for Europe, Italy overtook Britain, which has reported 64,026 deaths and is followed by France with 57,567 and Spain with 47,624. Italy was the first European country to suffer a wave of infections earlier this year. The UK’s toll overtook that of Italy on 6 May, with close to 30,000 fatalities, and for a while over the summer the southern European nation appeared to have weathered the storm. But despite the introduction of mass testing, cases began rising again in early autumn, as they did in many other nations - and deaths inevitably followed. Italy’s national medical association said Friday that a total of 251 doctors have now died from the virus. \"In this second wave, it is mainly general practitioners who are paying the highest toll,\" warned Filippo Anelli, head of the FNOMCeO association. He blamed \"greater circulation\" of asymptomatic patients, but added that all doctors did not have the necessary protective equipment. \"We must put an end to this massacre,\" he said.",

        "news": "The share of the Spanish population to have contracted coronavirus has nearly doubled to almost 10%, or about 4.7 million people, in the second wave of contagion since late summer, results from the latest stage of a nationwide antibody study showed. More than 51,400 people were tested and surveyed across Spain in the second half of November for the prevalence study, which suggests the infections by far exceed the number of confirmed cases in Spain, of just over 1.75 million. \"One in 10 people living in Spain would have been infected ... half during the first wave and the other half during this second epidemic wave,\" said Raquel Yotti, director of Spain’s Carlos III health institute, which co-led the study. Prevalence in Madrid was the highest of all Spanish regions, with 18.6% of the population testing positive for Covid-19 antibodies. Previous results of the study - published in July after testing nearly 70,000 people in April-June - showed a prevalence rate of just over 5%. Spain has been one of Europe’s hardest-hit countries by the pandemic, both in terms of contagion and the economic impact. A total of 48,401 people have died from the coronavirus, with the toll climbing by 388 over the last 24 hours. Data from the health ministry also showed 10,328 new coronavirus cases were reported on Tuesday, bringing the total since the onset of the pandemic to 1,762,212 infections. The infection rate measured over the previous 14 days is up for a second day in a row at nearly 199 cases per 100,000 people. The government decided a second state of emergency in October with new restrictions such as night-time curfews to stem resurgent infections, which helped to reduce new cases to less than 200 per 100,000 people this month.",

        "news": "British drugmaker AstraZeneca told Reuters its Covid-19 vaccine should be effective against the new coronavirus variant, adding studies were underway to fully probe the impact of the mutation. \"AZD1222 (AstraZeneca’s vaccine candidate) contains the genetic material of the SARS-CoV-2 virus spike protein, and the changes to the genetic code seen in this new viral strain do not appear to change the structure of the spike protein,\" an AstraZeneca representative said. Drugmakers are scrambling to test their Covid-19 vaccines against the new fast-spreading variant of the virus that is spreading in Britain, the latest challenge in the breakneck race to curb the pandemic. \"Through vaccination with AZD1222, the body’s immune system is trained to recognise many different parts of the spike protein, so that it can eliminate the virus if it is later exposed,\" the AstraZeneca representative added. The mutation, known as the B.1.1.7 lineage, may be up to 70% more infectious and more of a concern for children. It has sown chaos in Britain, prompting a wave of travel bans that are disrupting trade with Europe. The AstraZeneca-Oxford shot is considered vital for lower-income countries and those in hot climates because it is cheaper, easier to transport and can be stored for long periods at normal refrigerator temperatures. Data from AstraZeneca’s late-stage trials in the UK and Brazil released earlier this month showed the vaccine had efficacy of 62% for trial participants given two full doses, but 90% for a smaller sub-group given a half, then a full dose. Reuters reported late on Tuesday that India is likely to approve AstraZeneca’s vaccine for emergency use by next week.",

Diagnostic medicine company Dasa said it had detected the SARS-CoV-2 strain B.1.1.7 through genetic sequencing done in partnership with Sao Paulo university’s tropical medicine institute. \"Sequencing confirmed that the new strain of the virus has arrived in Brazil,\" said researcher Ester Sabino at the tropical medicine institute. The new variant has rapidly become the dominant strain in cases of Covid-19 in parts of southern England, and has been linked to an increase in hospitalisation rates. Australia, Italy and the Netherlands say they detected cases of the new strain. Scientists say that, while it is not more lethal than the original strain, it is significantly more transmissible. \"Given its high transmission power, this result reinforces the importance of quarantine, and of maintaining isolation for 10 days, especially for those who are coming or just arrived from Europe,\" Sabino said.",

Wright told media at a recent news conference: \"It’s a battle that at times we feel like we’re losing. It’s a battle that we have to fight every day and night, seven days a week.\" At least 35 members of Canterbury’s staff have tested positive for the coronavirus as of Monday, but Wright said he did not know how many have fallen ill.

But Gonzalez said that she expected Britain would lift its restrictions, making it unnecessary for the Spanish side to apply reciprocity. About 12 per cent of Spain’s economy is based on the tourism sector. According to the report of National Institute of Statistics, nearly 18 million British tourists visited Spain in 2019, more than a fifth of the overall total of nearly 84 million visitors.",

        "news": "Thousands of people hit the streets across Spain on Saturday to demand a collective rebuilding of society to tackle the fallout from the Covid-19 pandemic, in the biggest demonstrations since the crisis began. Called by the Workers Commissions and UGT unions, rallies took place throughout the day in some 60 towns and cities with organisers saying \"many thousands\" had taken part, without providing a figure. Unions are demanding a concerted response to ensure social and economic reconstruction following a crisis that has dealt a hammer blow to Spain’s economy. \"We want the country to be rebuilt, we need a national agreement so this pandemic won’t be politically exploited,\" UGT boss Pepe Alvarez told AFP in Madrid, where more than a thousand mask-wearing demonstrators held a socially-distanced march. \"We need to improve public services as part of a national agreement that leads to recovery and an improvement in our economy,\" Alvarez said. Although the government had done \"more than any government before\" through its furlough scheme and introducing a minimum basic income, there were still many people \"who are really suffering\", he said. Demonstrator Ana Sanchez de la Cueva, 61, said the aim was to ensure that ordinary people don’t end up paying for the crisis, either economically or in terms of their health. \"There are two reasons we’re here: to call for a proper economic recovery so we can all emerge from this crisis with dignity, and to demand that public services be strengthened,\" she said.",

The country’s prime minister, Jean Castex said on Friday that the government would strengthen controls at France’s borders in the hope of better containing the pandemic, with people arriving from some countries being subject to compulsory testing. Nearly 8,000 cases have been diagnosed in Catalonia over the past 14 days – accounting for almost half of the 16,410 detected across Spain.Catalonia’s public health secretary, Josep Maria Argimon, said the situation in and around Barcelona was \"at a critical moment\" and called on people to heed the regional government’s request not to leave their homes unless strictly necessary. Meanwhile, Norway has said it will reimpose a 10-day quarantine requirement for people arriving from Spain from Saturday after a surge in coronavirus cases there. However, the government also said it would ease restrictions on people coming from more counties of Sweden, according to Reuters.

        "news": "Sweden has chosen the right strategy in fighting the spread of the new coronavirus, prime minister Stefan Lofven said, defending his government’s decision not to adopt a strict lockdown as many European countries have done. More than 5,800 Swedes have died of Covid-19, a much higher death rate than Norway, Denmark and Finland which adopted much tougher measures, leading many to question the government’s approach. But Lofven said Sweden made the correct choice. \"The strategy that we adopted, I believe is right - to protect individuals, limit the spread of the infection, etc,\" he said in an interview in daily Dagens Nyheter. \"What has been discussed most, and what we did differently in Sweden, was that we did not close schools. Now there are quite a few people who think we were right.\" Whereas many countries enforced strict lockdowns, Sweden has relied mainly on voluntary measures focused on social distancing, though public gatherings have been limited and care homes - which saw a heavy death toll - quarantined. While Sweden has seen more fatalities than its neighbours, it has not been as badly hit as countries like Britain and Spain, which adopted much stricter lockdown measures. And many parts of Europe are seeing a pick up in new cases as they gradually loosen restrictions on travel and social interactions, Sweden has seen a decline in both infections and deaths in recent weeks. Lofven also defended the decision by the Public Health Agency not to enforce the wearing of facemasks, as many European countries have done, to fight the spread of the virus. \"What they are saying, and what I absolutely believe, is that they cannot be the main tool we use,\" Lofven said. \"What is important still is social distancing, testing and tracking. Those must be our main focus in order to reduce infection.\"",

The move follows targeted measures to reintroduce restrictions on public life in the worst affected parts of the country, as the government tries to tackle the spread of the virus without resorting to a complete lockdown. \"Due to the threat of spreading SARS CoV-2 virus infections, it is necessary to exercise the right to introduce air traffic bans... in order to minimize the threat to public health,\" the regulation said. Poland closed its borders and suspended flights in March to stop the spread of the coronavirus. However, it progressively loosened restrictions on public life, with shopping centres, hotels and restaurants all reopening in May. Polish national airline PLL LOT resumed international flights on 1 July almost four months after suspending them. Other countries affected by the ban are popular tourist destinations Montenegro and Croatia, as well as Romania, the US, Israel, Mexico and Brazil.

        "news": "Some more detail on news the Dutch government has tightened some of Europe’s most relaxed coronavirus rules after a surge in cases, ordering bars to shut early and recommending people wear masks in shops. The prime minister, Mark Rutte, told a news conference that the situation in the country’s three largest cities, Amsterdam, Rotterdam and The Hague, had become \"serious\" and required urgent action. \"We’re doing our best, but the virus is doing better,\" said the country’s health minister, Hugo de Jonge, adding that nearly 3,000 new infections were being recorded a day, with the figure expected to reach 5,000 within weeks. The Netherlands has so far avoided the harsh measures introduced by its European neighbours, preferring a so-called \"intelligent lockdown\" and refusing to order the wearing of masks. But people were now advised to wear masks while shopping in the three big cities, with retailers allowed to refuse entry to those who did not, Rutte said. However, Rutte said that masks - which are already compulsory on public transport – \"won’t do the big trick\" and had not worked in France or Spain by themselves. Restaurants and bars must now close at 10pm, while people may only have four people to visit over the age of 13, Rutte said. Sports matches will be played behind closed doors again, including top-tier Eredivisie football, which had only just begun its new season with a limited number of spectators. Rutte had warned fans recently to \"keep their mouths shut\" after many had defied a ban on chanting. Working from home should once again become standard, de Jonge said.",

        "news": "Madrid residents are set to be barred from leaving the city except on essential trips under new coronavirus restrictions announced by the Spanish government. The city’s borders will also be closed to outsiders for non-necessary visits under the new measures for large municipalities with high coronavirus infection rates. Another nine cities in the metropolitan area will also be affected. \"Madrid’s health is Spain’s health. Madrid is special,\" health minister Salvador Illa told a news conference to announce the new regulations, which are due to come into force in the coming days. He did not say exactly when. People will be allowed to cross municipal boundaries to go to work or school, visit the doctor or go shopping, but must remain within the city for leisure activities, according to the agreement. Other measures include the closure of bars and restaurants at 11pm, from a previous curfew of 1am, as well as the closure of public parks and playgrounds. Social gatherings will be limited to six people. Currently a hotbed for infection, the Madrid region accounts for more than a third of the 133,604 cases diagnosed in Spain over the past two weeks. Madrid has 735 cases per 100,000 people, one of the highest of any region in Europe and double the national rate The conservative regional assembly had already enforced localised lockdowns in 45, mostly poor districts, often with a high immigrant population. But the new wider restrictions see the central government overriding the regional government after weeks of fighting between the two authorities over what should be done in the capital city. This has taken the political polarisation that has characterised much of the response to the pandemic over the past months to new heights, exasperating inhabitants. Spain has recorded a total of 769,188 cases, more than any other nation in western Europe. The total death toll stands at 31,791. \"We must be conscious that there are tough weeks, very tough, ahead,\" Illa said.",

        "news": "Widespread reopening of schools after lockdowns and vacations is generally not linked to rising Covid-19 rates, a study of 191 countries has found, but lockdown closures will leave a 2020 \"pandemic learning debt\" of 300bn missed school days. The analysis, by the Geneva-based independent educational foundation Insights for Education, said 84% of those 300bn days would be lost by children in poorer countries, and warned that 711 million pupils were still out of school. \"It’s been assumed that opening schools will drive infections, and that closing schools will reduce transmission, but the reality is much more complex,\" said IfE’s founder and chief executive Randa Grob-Zakhary. The vast majority – 92% – of countries that are through their first wave of Covid-19 infections have started to reopen school systems, even as some are seeing a second surge. IfE found that 52 countries – including France and Spain – that sent students back to school in August and September saw infection rates rise during the vacation compared to when they were closed. In Britain and Hungary, however, infection levels dropped after initial school closures, remained low during the holidays, and began rising after reopening. Full analysis of these 52 countries found no firm correlation between school status and infections – pointing to a need to consider other factors, IfE said. \"The key now is to learn from those countries that are reopening effectively against a backdrop of rising infections,\" Grob-Zakhary said. The report said 44 countries have kept schools closed. It found countries are developing strategies for schools during the pandemic, such as in Italy and France, which order temporary school closures on a case-by-case basis. Other measures include policies on masks, class rotations and combining remote with in-school lessons. Grob-Zakhary said: This first real global test highlights what school life looks like in a Covid-world. Understanding how countries undergoing a massive second wave are dealing with this new reality in the classroom is essential to guide future reopening decisions and to help schools remain open.",

In 11 out of 16 English cities and towns where restrictions were imposed nine weeks ago, the infection rate has at least doubled, with cases in five areas of Greater Manchester rising faster than the England average in that time. In Wigan, cases have risen from seven per 100,000 residents to 102 in that period. Leicester is the only one of the 16 areas to record fewer cases than when the measures were implemented. The findings will raise concerns after Prof Chris Whitty, the chief medical officer for England, said the government’s strategy was to limit the virus to regional hotspots. \"If everybody follows the guidance, then we could actually contain it within the areas it is [now] in the way that happened to some degree in Italy and Spain,\" he said at a press conference on Wednesday.",

        "news": "Italy has made it mandatory to wear face masks outdoors nationwide in an effort to curb the spread of the coronavirus, as new infections rose to the highest daily tally since April. The decree was approved at a cabinet meeting after a steady increase in cases over the last two months. It will probably be effective from Thursday, a government source said. Several Italian regions including Lazio, around the capital Rome, had already made face masks mandatory. Data from the health ministry showed 3,678 cases were reported in the last 24 hours, up from 2,677 on Tuesday and surging past the 3,000 mark for the first time since 24 April. Italy is still recording far fewer daily cases than other large European countries such as France, Spain and the UK. As a part of Rome’s effort to curb the spread of the virus, the health minister Roberto Speranza on Wednesday ordered compulsory testing on travellers from the United Kingdom, Belgium, the Netherlands and Czech Republic [see 8.35pm]. Italy was the first country in Europe to be hard-hit by Covid-19 and has the second highest death toll in the continent after the UK, with 36,061 deaths recorded since the outbreak began in February, according to official figures. Thanks to one of the strictest lockdowns in the world, the government managed to get the virus under control by the summer but infections are now rising fast. However, daily Covid-related deaths remain far lower than during the first wave of Italy’s epidemic six months ago. Some 31 people died on Wednesday, the health ministry said, while 24 April, the last day with more than 3,000 cases, saw 420 deaths. The cabinet on Wednesday also approved a decree to extend the Covid-19 state of emergency to 31 January. The state of emergency, originally due to expire in mid-October, gives greater powers to central government, making it easier for officials to bypass the bureaucracy that smothers much decision-making in Italy.",

The government will hold an extraordinary cabinet meeting on Friday morning to decree the state of emergency if Madrid does not impose the restrictions or request intervention, the government said. Following a health ministry order, Madrid authorities reluctantly barred all non-essential travel to and from the city and nine surrounding towns last Friday to curb the spread of Covid-19 in one of Europe’s worst virus hotspots. A Madrid regional court on Thursday annulled the measures ordered by the national health ministry, ruling the government had overstepped its mandate and the restrictions interfered with fundamental human rights. Declaring a state of emergency - the same legal framework that underpinned Spain’s tough lockdown during the first wave of the virus - would grant the national government the powers to restrict movement. According to a government statement, the prime Minister Pedro Sanchez told Madrid’s regional leader Isabel Diaz Ayuso that she must either enforce the restrictions, request a state of emergency or the central government would unilaterally impose one. The government said: In any of the three cases the measures would be exactly the same as those already being applied, the only thing that would change would be the legal instrument. Ayuso said regional officials would discuss alternatives on Friday morning. She said in a statement: We hope to agree on a solution that benefits citizens and provides clarity.",

France is reporting the highest seven-day average of new cases in Europe with 19,425 infections per day followed by the United Kingdom, Russia, Spain and the Netherlands in the list of worst affected European countries. Several European countries are closing schools, cancelling elective surgeries and enlisting student medics as the authorities face a Covid-19 resurgence. Russia is moving students to online learning and Northern Ireland is closing schools for two weeks and restaurants for four. In Spain, authorities in Catalonia ordered bars and restaurants to close for 15 days and limited the numbers of people allowed in shops. The Czech Republic has also shifted schools to distance learning and plans to call up thousands of medical students. Hospitals are cutting non-urgent medical procedures to free up beds. Polish health officials have warned the country is on the brink of a disaster as a record 6,526 new coronavirus infections and 116 deaths were reported this week. Poland is ramping up training for nurses and considering creating military field hospitals. Latin America is the worst-affected region with about 27% of total Covid-19 cases followed by Asia, North America and Europe. India is reporting fewer cases this month compared with September, with 69,000 cases per day. The numbers have fallen by more than 20,400 over the last three weeks, down 22% from its previous peak. India reported 55,342 cases on 13 October, its lowest daily increase since 18 August. In the US, which has the largest total number of cases and deaths in the world, new infections are edging higher along with the most hospitalised Covid-19 patients since early September.",

On Tuesday, the ministry reported 1,259,366 cases. Unlike France, Germany and the UK, which have imposed nationwide lockdowns, Spain has adopted a regional response to tackling the pandemic, leading to a patchwork of different regulations. Murcia on Wednesday joined several other regions including Catalonia in shutting down bars and restaurants, while the northern region of Cantabria banned citizens from travelling across municipal borders. Health minister Salvador Illa told a news conference it would take two to three weeks for the latest regional restrictions to produce effect, but added that \"there is still margin to take additional measures, there are a great many steps we can still take\", without specifying.",

        "news": "The Spanish government agreed with regional authorities on Wednesday that a maximum of 10 people per household will be allowed to gather for the Christmas and New Year holidays to avoid spreading the coronavirus, the health minister Salvador Illa said. The agreement, which applies to celebrations on Christmas Eve, Christmas, New Year’s Eve and on New Year’s Day, means a slight relaxation of the current general rule that allows gatherings of up to six people, except in some regions that have defined their own limits. The start of the night-time curfews in force in most Spanish regions would be moved to 1:30am from 11pm on 24 and 31 December. Still, movement of people between regions will be banned, with some exceptions, between 23 December and 6 January, Illa told a news conference, adding that although the latest infection data inspired some optimism, prudence was paramount. To sum it up, this Christmas we stay at home ... It is desirable that people restrict their mobility and social contacts as much as possible. Governments across Europe are trying to navigate between avoiding spreading the virus over the holiday season and allowing people to celebrate with family and friends. The 10-person limit includes children, and the official recommendation is for people from the same household to celebrate together without outside guests. Spain imposed a six-month state of emergency in October, giving regions legal backing to impose curfews and other restrictions. While the rate of infection in the country has slowed since, its overall tally of over 1.66m Covid-19 cases is among the highest in western Europe. The death toll reached 45,784 on Wednesday.",

        "news": "Italy on Saturday became the European country with the highest official number of Covid fatalities, as its new total of 64,036 deaths overtook Britain, according to an Agence France-Presse tally. The Italian health ministry said that 649 people had died from the virus in the previous 24 hours and that 19,903 new cases had been diagnosed. Worldwide, the US has reported the highest number of Covid-19 deaths, with 295,539 as of Saturday morning, followed by Brazil, India and Mexico. According to the AFP tally for Europe, Italy overtook Britain, which has reported 64,026 deaths and is followed by France with 57,567 and Spain with 47,624. Italy was the first European country to suffer a wave of infections earlier this year. The UK’s toll overtook that of Italy on 6 May, with close to 30,000 fatalities, and for a while over the summer the southern European nation appeared to have weathered the storm. But despite the introduction of mass testing, cases began rising again in early autumn, as they did in many other nations - and deaths inevitably followed. Italy’s national medical association said Friday that a total of 251 doctors have now died from the virus. \"In this second wave, it is mainly general practitioners who are paying the highest toll,\" warned Filippo Anelli, head of the FNOMCeO association. He blamed \"greater circulation\" of asymptomatic patients, but added that all doctors did not have the necessary protective equipment. \"We must put an end to this massacre,\" he said.",

        "news": "The share of the Spanish population to have contracted coronavirus has nearly doubled to almost 10%, or about 4.7 million people, in the second wave of contagion since late summer, results from the latest stage of a nationwide antibody study showed. More than 51,400 people were tested and surveyed across Spain in the second half of November for the prevalence study, which suggests the infections by far exceed the number of confirmed cases in Spain, of just over 1.75 million. \"One in 10 people living in Spain would have been infected ... half during the first wave and the other half during this second epidemic wave,\" said Raquel Yotti, director of Spain’s Carlos III health institute, which co-led the study. Prevalence in Madrid was the highest of all Spanish regions, with 18.6% of the population testing positive for Covid-19 antibodies. Previous results of the study - published in July after testing nearly 70,000 people in April-June - showed a prevalence rate of just over 5%. Spain has been one of Europe’s hardest-hit countries by the pandemic, both in terms of contagion and the economic impact. A total of 48,401 people have died from the coronavirus, with the toll climbing by 388 over the last 24 hours. Data from the health ministry also showed 10,328 new coronavirus cases were reported on Tuesday, bringing the total since the onset of the pandemic to 1,762,212 infections. The infection rate measured over the previous 14 days is up for a second day in a row at nearly 199 cases per 100,000 people. The government decided a second state of emergency in October with new restrictions such as night-time curfews to stem resurgent infections, which helped to reduce new cases to less than 200 per 100,000 people this month.",

Two weeks ago, Costa had said people would be able to return home before a 2am curfew on New Year’s Eve. But a previously announced reevaluation of measures took into consideration the current pandemic situation and forced the government to take a step back. \"The number of cases per week are dropping but not as fast as they were before,\" Costa said, explaining the government decided to toughen New Year’s Eve measures so rules over Christmas were not as severe. There is no limit on how many people can gather per household for Christmas and a ban on domestic travel will not be imposed between 23-26 December. \"Christmas celebrations have to be carried out with the utmost care,\" he said, urging people to avoid poorly ventilated spaces and to use face masks during family gatherings whenever possible. After a relatively mild first wave of the disease compared with countries such as Spain or Italy, Portugal has had a record number of infections and deaths during the second wave though the daily tally has dropped slightly in recent weeks.

Brazil registered 1,001 daily coronavirus deaths on Friday, taking the total deaths to 21,048, according to the health ministry. However, the true numbers – both of cases and deaths – is probably higher as Latin America’s top economy has been slow to ramp up testing. Meanwhile Brazil’s environment minister, Ricardo Salles, called on the government to push through further deregulation of environmental policy while people are distracted by the coronavirus pandemic, in a video the supreme court ordered to be released. The video of a ministers’ meeting surfaced in an investigation of whether the president, Jair Bolsonaro, interfered in appointing leaders of the federal police for personal gain. During the meeting, other ministers spoke, including Salles, with environmental groups saying his remarks prove that the Bolsonaro government is systematically seeking to dismantle environmental protections. \"We need to make an effort while we are in this calm moment in terms of press coverage, because they are only talking about Covid, and push through and change all the rules and simplify norms,\" Salles said in the video. Deforestation hit an 11-year high last year and has increased 55% in the first four months of the year, compared with a year ago, with environmentalists blaming Bolsonaro’s policies.",

Ecuador is one of nations hardest hit by the coronavirus pandemic in Latin America. As major cities like Quito begin to reopen, authorities have insisted on the need to increases testing. But those efforts have been complicated by corruption scandals, delays in acquiring tests and now shortages of essential lab materials. \"We have the tests and we can’t use them,\" city councilman Bernardo Abad said. \"They were purchased but the city didn’t prepare.\" The Central University lab is one of two contracted directly by Quito officials to boost the city’s testing capability. The other has not yet begun processing specimens. The Ministry of Public Health operates its own labs and conducted 16,379 tests in Quito from March to May. That testing is expected to continue, though to date has fallen short of what many believe is needed in the city of 2.7m people.

We must be clear that opening up too early gives this virus more room to spread and puts our populations at greater risk. Look no further than Europe. Etienne said governments must monitor travel very carefully because reopening to tourism can lead to setbacks. That has happened in the Caribbean, where several countries that had virtually no cases have experienced spikes as tourism resumed. According to a Reuters tally, Latin America has recorded around 8.4 million coronavirus cases, and over 314,000 deaths, both figures being the highest of any region.",

        "news": "Global coronavirus cases rose by more than 400,000 for the first time late on Friday, a record one-day increase as much of Europe enacts new restrictions to curb the outbreak. Europe, which successfully damped down the first surge of infections, has emerged as the new coronavirus epicentre in recent weeks and is reporting on average 140,000 cases a day over the past week. As a region, Europe is reporting more daily cases than India, Brazil and the US combined. Of every 100 infections reported around the world, 34 were from European countries, according to a Reuters analysis. The region is currently reporting a million new infections about every nine days and has reported more than 6.3 million cases since the pandemic began. Major European countries - the UK, France, Russia, the Netherlands and Spain - accounted for about half of Europe’s new cases in the week to 18 October. France is reporting the highest seven-day average of new cases in Europe with 19,425 infections per day followed by the United Kingdom, Russia, Spain and the Netherlands in the list of worst affected European countries. Several European countries are closing schools, cancelling elective surgeries and enlisting student medics as the authorities face a Covid-19 resurgence. Russia is moving students to online learning and Northern Ireland is closing schools for two weeks and restaurants for four. In Spain, authorities in Catalonia ordered bars and restaurants to close for 15 days and limited the numbers of people allowed in shops. The Czech Republic has also shifted schools to distance learning and plans to call up thousands of medical students. Hospitals are cutting non-urgent medical procedures to free up beds. Polish health officials have warned the country is on the brink of a disaster as a record 6,526 new coronavirus infections and 116 deaths were reported this week. Poland is ramping up training for nurses and considering creating military field hospitals. Latin America is the worst-affected region with about 27% of total Covid-19 cases followed by Asia, North America and Europe. India is reporting fewer cases this month compared with September, with 69,000 cases per day. The numbers have fallen by more than 20,400 over the last three weeks, down 22% from its previous peak. India reported 55,342 cases on 13 October, its lowest daily increase since 18 August. In the US, which has the largest total number of cases and deaths in the world, new infections are edging higher along with the most hospitalised Covid-19 patients since early September.",

        "news": "The test used to diagnose coronavirus is being rolled out to laboratories across the UK from Monday, increasing testing capacity to more than 1,000 people a day. Currently coronavirus is tested and diagnosed in one laboratory in London, but testing will be extended to 12 labs across the country over the coming weeks. At its laboratories in London, Public Health England (PHE) has the capacity to process samples from more than 100 people a day. Now, to ensure that the country is prepared for further cases and to speed up the time taken to get results, the test will be carried out by trained scientists across England, Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland. This will increase testing capacity to more than 1,000 people a day for England. Prof Yvonne Doyle, PHE’s medical director, said: Once China confirmed that they had identified a novel coronavirus, Public Health England was ready to test potential cases in this country. We have now trained scientists in labs across the UK to conduct the specialist test – ensuring that we are well prepared should we begin to see an increased number of cases across the country. The test, developed by PHE, made the UK one of the first countries outside China to have assured testing capability for the new coronavirus. When a clinician suspects coronavirus in a patient, they take samples from the nose, throat and deeper respiratory tract and send them for laboratory testing. Using the diagnostic test, scientists can look for evidence of the presence of any type of coronavirus and then hone in on specific genetic clues that identify the novel coronavirus associated with this outbreak. The UK-wide roll-out is the fastest deployment of a new test to PHE and NHS labs in recent history, including in the swine flu pandemic in 2009. In addition to processing samples from suspected cases in the UK, PHE is now working as a reference laboratory for WHO, testing samples from countries that do not have assured testing capabilities.",

Assange is currently in the high security Belmarsh prison in south London as he fights an extradition request by the United States to stand trial there on espionage charges. Baraitser pointed out that the 48-year-old, who followed proceedings via videolink, had already violated a bail order when he fled to the Ecuadorian embassy in 2012. At that time, Swedish authorities were attempting to extradite him over sexual assault claims that were later dropped. Assange’s lawyer, Edward Fitzgerald, said there was currently no Covid-19 case at Belmarsh but 100 prison officers were off work and there was a \"very real risk - and the risk could be fatal\".",

        "news": "Schools in Greenwich, south-east London, have been asked to close from Monday evening after \"exponential growth\" of coronavirus demanded \"immediate action\", the council said, amid reports that the capital is likely to enter tier 3 soon. Council leader Danny Thorpe said: \"I’m writing this open letter to let you know the situation in Greenwich in relation to Covid-19 is now escalating extremely quickly and I have today been briefed by colleagues from Public Health England that the pandemic in Greenwich is now showing signs that we are in a period of exponential growth that demands immediate action.\" He added that Greenwich now has the highest rates of infection at any time since March. Schools have been told to move to online learning for the rest of the term, with the exception of key worker children and those with specific needs. Writing to headteachers, Thorpe described the issue as \"honestly one of the most difficult questions I have wrestled with during all my time as leader\". He added: \"The DFE (Department for Education) are clear this isn’t their position and indeed have issued directives to some schools. However, I cannot in all good conscience stand by whilst the numbers are doubling so quickly.\" It comes amid growing reports that the capital is likely to be moved into tier 3 measures soon, with a PA analysis finding that the London borough of Havering now has the fifth highest rate of new Covid-19 cases in England. A total of 1,314 new cases were recorded in Havering in the seven days to 9 December – a sharp increase from 834 new cases in the previous seven days. Five other London boroughs are also in the top 25 highest rates in England: Redbridge, Waltham Forest, Barking &amp; Dagenham, Enfield and Newham. Rates are currently rising in all 32 London boroughs.",

        "news": "One of London’s biggest hospitals has warned that it is on track to become virtually Covid-only amid a surge in cases in the capital that has left it scrambling to convert operating theatres, surgical recovery areas and stroke wards into intensive care units for the very sick. As the Covid case numbers in the UK continued an apparently inexorable rise, hitting 55,892, with 23,813 in hospitals and 964 reported deaths, the chief executive of University College London Hospitals trust, Prof Marcel Levi, said admissions were already spiraling beyond the first wave in the spring. Every hospital in London was facing the same demands on beds and staff, and UCLH was taking admissions from other hospitals that were less well able to cope, he told the Guardian. \"This is much more than we had in March and April,\" said Levi, an acute medicine doctor. The 500-bed hospital has 220 Covid patients, with the numbers increasing by 5% a day, but the real pressure is on intensive care where there are now 70 very sick patients, as there were in the spring, and rising fast. \"Usually in our ITU we have about 35 patients so we are already doubled in size at UCLH. We are further surging upon the request of London to 92 patients in the next week, and thereafter probably we will have to grow even further,\" he said. At UCLH, whole floors are having to be dismantled and rebuilt to the standards required for intensive care wards. As they did in March, they have had to convert five floors and equip them with oxygen and continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) machines that help people breathe.",

He said: Having a name matters to prevent the use of other names that can be inaccurate or stigmatising. It also gives us a standard format to use for any future coronavirus outbreaks. Coronaviruses are a large family of viruses, responsible for the Sars (severe acute respiratory syndrome) outbreak in 2002-03, and Mers (Middle East respiratory syndrome).

In 11 out of 16 English cities and towns where restrictions were imposed nine weeks ago, the infection rate has at least doubled, with cases in five areas of Greater Manchester rising faster than the England average in that time. In Wigan, cases have risen from seven per 100,000 residents to 102 in that period. Leicester is the only one of the 16 areas to record fewer cases than when the measures were implemented. The findings will raise concerns after Prof Chris Whitty, the chief medical officer for England, said the government’s strategy was to limit the virus to regional hotspots. \"If everybody follows the guidance, then we could actually contain it within the areas it is [now] in the way that happened to some degree in Italy and Spain,\" he said at a press conference on Wednesday.",

        "news": "Hello, this is Michael Safi, I’ll be updating you with the latest developments in this story over the next hours. We’re getting a little more now from the press conference (given online, not in person) by the Chinese foreign ministry. The government has been at pains to emphasise that it has the tools to control the spread of this coronavirus outbreak, but this morning did concede it needs help – in the form of protective medical equipment. \"What China urgently needs at present are medical masks, protective suits and safety goggles,\" the foreign ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying said in a press briefing on Monday morning. China’s factories can produce 20 million masks a day, but panic over the virus has prompted people in the country of 1.4 billion to stock up on them, while frontline medical personnel have reported equipment shortages. Agence France-Presse provides this context: At full capacity, China’s factories are only able to produce around 20m masks a day, according to the ministry of industry. The foreign ministry said countries including South Korea, Japan, Kazakhstan and Hungary had donated medical supplies. Tian Yulong, of the industry ministry, said earlier on Monday that authorities were taking steps to bring in masks from Europe, Japan and the US, adding that supply and demand in China remained in \"tight equilibrium\" as factories returned to production after the lunar new year break. He said they were now operating at between 60% and 70% capacity. In addition to Hubei, the province of more than 50 million people at the centre of the outbreak, several other provinces and cities across China have made it compulsory to wear masks in public. These include Guangdong – China’s most populous province – plus Sichuan, Jiangxi, Liaoning and the city of Nanjing, with a combined population of more than 300 million.",

Most worryingly, there has been an increase in the number of cases where the Japanese health ministry has been unable to figure out the origin of the transmission.

KCNA did not specifically mention whether the individual had been tested, but said an \"uncertain result was made from several medical check-ups of the secretion of that person’s upper respiratory organ and blood,\" prompting officials to quarantine the person and investigate anyone he may have been in contact with.

The remarkable statement comes after reports that about two dozen passengers aboard a cruise ship that docked in Bayonne, New Jersey, on Friday morning were screened for coronavirus and four were sent to a local hospital for further screening. In a statement published on its website, Royal Caribbean said that none of the four passengers tested showed clinical signs or symptoms of coronavirus, although one tested positive onboard for flu. However, the company said it would be adopting a number of health screening protocols, including the following: Regardless of nationality, any guest or crew member traveling from, to, or through mainland China, Hong Kong, or Macau less than 15 days prior to their sailing will be unable to board any of our ships. Additionally, there will be mandatory specialized health screenings performed on: a. Guests who are unsure if they have been in contact with individuals who have traveled from, to or through mainland China or Hong Kong in the past 15 days; b. Guests who report feeling unwell or demonstrate any flu-like symptoms; c. Any guest presenting with fever or low blood oximetry in the specialized health screening will be denied boarding.",

        "news": "China has ordered three reporters from American newspaper the Wall Street Journal to leave the country, over what Beijing deemed a racist headline. The expulsion came as Beijing slammed Washington’s decision to tighten rules on Chinese state media organisations in the United States, calling the move \"unreasonable and unacceptable\", AFP reports. A Chinese foreign ministry spokesman Geng Shuang said the Journal op-ed - titled \"China is the Real Sick Man of Asia\" - had a \"racially discriminatory\" and \"sensational\" headline, and slammed the newspaper for not issuing an official apology. Geng told a press briefing: As such, China has decided that from today, the press cards of three Wall Street Journal reporters in Beijing will be revoked. The Journal reported that deputy bureau chief Josh Chin and reporter Chao Deng, both US nationals, as well as reporter Philip Wen, an Australian, had been ordered to leave the country in five days. The three journalists are in the Wall Street Journal’s news section, which is not linked to the editorial and opinion section. The op-ed, written by Bard College professor Walter Russell Mead, criticised the Chinese government’s initial response to the new coronavirus outbreak. It called the Wuhan city government \"secretive and self-serving\", while dismissing national efforts as ineffective. The phrase \"sick man of Asia\" originally referred to China in the late 19th and early 20th century, when it was exploited by foreign powers during a period sometimes called the country’s \"century of humiliation\". The 3 February piece \"slandered the efforts of the Chinese government and the Chinese people to fight the epidemic\", said Geng. The new coronavirus epidemic has killed over 2,000 people in China and infected more than 74,000, and has spread to at least two dozen countries. \"The editors of the Wall Street Journal have nailed themselves to the pillar of shame,\" wrote the nationalistic Global Times in an op-ed on Tuesday before the reporters were expelled. The WSJ’s remarks \"sound like gloating, and they disgust Chinese people\", it said. The expulsions come a day after the United States angered China for classifying five state media outlets, including Xinhua news agency and the China Global Television Network, as foreign missions, with State Department officials saying they were part of Beijing’s growing \"propaganda\" apparatus. Voicing China’s \"strong dissatisfaction\", Geng added cryptically: \"We reserve the right to respond further to this matter.\"",

The World Health Assembly is being held virtually on Monday and Taiwan’s attendance – as well as a possible international inquiry into the start of the pandemic – are likely to be the two big political flashpoints between China and the west. Chinese diplomats have been contacting governments across Europe to limit the diplomatic support for Taiwan’s attendance, targeting northern and eastern European states. Maintaining collective EU unity on China is proving difficult. But in a letter to the Guardian, the former Nato secretary general Anders Fogh Rasmussen, the former president of Poland Aleksander Kwaśniewski and the former Swedish prime minister Carl Bildt argue that Taiwan should be permitted to attend because of its pioneering response to the pandemic, which has drawn on the lessons of the 2003 Sars outbreak.",

Thank you to those who fought and continue to fight for our great nation.⠀Have a safe and happy Fourth of July. 🇺🇸 His critics are bitterly divided, however. One camp is voicing disappointment in his leadership amid rising infections, while the other is clamouring for his resignation after he issued an executive order on Thursday requiring Texans to wear face coverings in public in counties with 20 or more Covid-19 cases.",

        "news": "Florida has surpassed 500,000 coronavirus cases as testing ramps up following a temporary shutdown of some sites because of Tropical Storm Isaias. A long line of cars waited outside Hard Rock Stadium in Miami Gardens on Wednesday morning for a coronavirus testing site to reopen after being closed because of the storm. Florida reported 225 new deaths on Wednesday, bringing its seven-day average of daily reported deaths to a high of 185, behind Texas with 197. Florida’s rate is approaching a quarter of that seen in New York at its peak in mid-April. The number of people treated in hospitals statewide for the coronavirus continued a two-week decline, with 7,622 patients late Wednesday morning, a decrease of 175 from the previous day and down from highs of 9,500 two weeks ago. The Florida Department of Health reported 5,409 new coronavirus cases on Wednesday. Overall, Florida’s reported 502,739 cases ranks second to California, with more than 527,000 cases, and above Texas with more than 466,000, according to Johns Hopkins University. The Hard Rock site briefly shut down on Wednesday because of lightning in the area. Testing resumed once the weather cleared. Florida governor Ron DeSantis this week announced that quicker testing, with results in about 15 minutes, would be offered at the stadium and at Marlins Park. \"Obviously if you are somebody that is symptomatic and you don’t get your result back for seven days that is not helpful. For asymptomatic test takers, if it takes seven days then the test is basically useless at that time,\" DeSantis said.",

        "title": "Texas, Florida, California and New York among states not following new US Covid-19 testing plan",
        "news": "Several large US states including Texas are not heeding new federal health officials’ calls to reduce Covid-19 testing of some exposed to the virus, joining a broad rebuke of the Trump administration by public health leaders. Arizona, California, Connecticut, Florida, Illinois, Texas, New Jersey and New York all plan to continue to test asymptomatic people who have been exposed to Covid-19, despite new guidance from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) suggesting that such tests may not be needed. \"The current Texas guidance recommends testing for all close contacts of a confirmed case because it allows for early case identification among people who are at a higher risk of infection,\" a spokesman for the Texas Department of State Health Services in a statement. \"There’s not a planned change at this point.\" California and New York made similar statements. The Florida Department of Health said asymptomatic testing was continuing while the new CDC recommendations were evaluated, and Texas also said it would evaluate. The CDC said this week that people exposed to Covid-19 but not symptomatic may not need to be tested, shocking doctors and politicians, and prompting accusations the guidance was politically motivated. Even before the CDC guidance, coronavirus testing in the US had dropped. The US tested on average 675,000 people a day last week, down from a peak in late July of over 800,000 people a day. Nationally, cases have fallen for five weeks in a row but infections are surging again in the US Midwest with four states reporting record one-day increases in cases on Thursday as the US death toll climbed above 180,000. The CDC had previously recommended testing of all people who had close contact with someone who was diagnosed with Covid-19. New York governor Andrew Cuomo said the state of New York would not be abiding by the new guidance and challenged the assertion that politics played no role in the change. \"This 180-degree reversal of Covid-19 testing guidelines is reckless, and not based on science and has the potential to do long-term damage to the (CDC’s) reputation,\" Cuomo said in a joint statement, along with the governors of New Jersey and Connecticut, who also said their states would not be following the CDC’s guidance. Admiral Brett Giroir, the assistant secretary for health at the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), said there was no political pressure from the administration. He said that testing asymptomatic patients too early could produce false negatives and contribute to the virus’s spread. CNN and The New York Times reported on Wednesday that US public health officials were ordered by high-level members of the Trump administration to push forward with the changes. CDC director Robert Redfield issued a statement on Thursday that \"everyone who needs a Covid-19 test, can get a test,\" but \"everyone who wants a test does not necessarily need a test.\" Globally, many nations advocate early testing. The World Health Organization on Thursday said, that resources permitting, people exposed to the coronavirus should be tested even if they do not show immediate symptoms of infection. European governments have used broad testing and isolation to control the virus. France, for instance, recommends that anyone who thinks they need a test should get one and in Germany, people with close contact of 15 minutes or more with a person with Covid-19 are advised to have a test.",

        "news": "A dozen US states reported record one-day increases in Covid-19 cases on Thursday, a day after the country set a record with nearly 105,000 new infections reported on Wednesday, according to a Reuters tally. The outbreak is spreading in every region of the country but is hitting the Midwest the hardest, based on new cases per capita. Illinois reported nearly 10,000 new cases and along with Texas is leading the nation in the most cases reported in the last seven days. Other Midwestern states with record increases in cases on Thursday were Indiana, Iowa, Minnesota, Missouri, North Dakota and Ohio. Arkansas, Maine, Oklahoma, Rhode Island, Utah and West Virginia also set records for rises in new infections. Some cities and states have announced new measures such as curfews or reduced gathering sizes to combat the spread of the virus, but the United States has taken no action at the federal level. Seventeen out of 50 states do not require masks. Many countries in Europe are shutting high-risk businesses and even ordering national or regional lockdowns as a second wave sweeps over the continent. In addition to rising cases, US hospitalisations of patients with Covid-19 rose to over 52,500 on Thursday, up for an 11th day in a row and getting closer to the record of 58,370 set in July. North Dakota reported only eight free intensive care unit beds in the entire state on Thursday. Hospitalisation are a key metric because they are not affected by the amount of testing done. Coronavirus deaths are trending higher but not at the same rate as cases. The United States is averaging 850 deaths a day, up from 700 a month ago. In recent days, six states have reported their highest one-day increases in deaths ever: Arkansas, Idaho, North Dakota, South Dakota, West Virginia and Wyoming. The pandemic has affected nearly every aspect of American life, including a record number of voters mailing in their ballots in Tuesday’s presidential election, whose outcome has yet to be decided.

The country’s second-most populous state, Teas has recorded 1.01 million coronavirus cases and over 19,000 deaths since the outbreak began in early March, according to data compiled by Johns Hopkins University. California, the most populous state, has logged more than 991,000 cases. The US has recorded more than 240,000 deaths and about 10.3 million confirmed infections, with new cases soaring to all-time highs of well over 120,000 per day over the past week. The country also surpassed 1 million new confirmed cases in just the first 10 days of November (see 1.04pm.). Health experts have blamed the increase in part on the onset of cold weather and growing frustration with mask-wearing and other precautions. Cases per day are on the rise in 49 states, and deaths per day are climbing in 39. A month ago, the US was seeing about 730 Covid-19 deaths per day on average; that has now surpassed 970.",

        "news": "A new report by Oxfam warns that the hunger crisis worsened by the pandemic could potentially kill more people each day than the infection itself, which has claimed more than half a million lives so far. An estimated 12,000 people per day could die from hunger linked to Covid-19 by the end of the year, Oxfam said. By comparison, data from Johns Hopkins University shows that the pandemic’s deadliest day so far was 17 April, when 8,890 deaths were recorded, CNN reports. \"The pandemic is the final straw for millions of people already struggling with the impacts of conflict, climate change, inequality and a broken food system that has impoverished millions of food producers and workers,\" Oxfam’s interim executive director Chema Vera said in a release. Among the issues that have left many unable to put food on the table are lost income caused by unemployment or a reduction in remittance payments, the lack of social support for those who work in the informal economy, and disruptions to the supply chain and hurdles faced by producers. Also contributing to the crisis are the travel restrictions related to lockdowns, which impact not just workers and farmers, but also the delivery of humanitarian aid. In its briefing, Oxfam calls out food and beverage industry titans like Coca-Cola, Unilever, General Mills among others. \"Meanwhile, those at the top are continuing to make a profit: eight of the biggest food and drink companies paid out over $18 billion to shareholders since January even as the pandemic was spreading across the globe ― ten times more than the UN says is needed to stop people going hungry,\" the release reads.",

A long line of cars waited outside Hard Rock Stadium in Miami Gardens on Wednesday morning for a coronavirus testing site to reopen after being closed because of the storm. Florida reported 225 new deaths on Wednesday, bringing its seven-day average of daily reported deaths to a high of 185, behind Texas with 197. Florida’s rate is approaching a quarter of that seen in New York at its peak in mid-April. The number of people treated in hospitals statewide for the coronavirus continued a two-week decline, with 7,622 patients late Wednesday morning, a decrease of 175 from the previous day and down from highs of 9,500 two weeks ago. The Florida Department of Health reported 5,409 new coronavirus cases on Wednesday. Overall, Florida’s reported 502,739 cases ranks second to California, with more than 527,000 cases, and above Texas with more than 466,000, according to Johns Hopkins University. The Hard Rock site briefly shut down on Wednesday because of lightning in the area. Testing resumed once the weather cleared. Florida governor Ron DeSantis this week announced that quicker testing, with results in about 15 minutes, would be offered at the stadium and at Marlins Park. \"Obviously if you are somebody that is symptomatic and you don’t get your result back for seven days that is not helpful. For asymptomatic test takers, if it takes seven days then the test is basically useless at that time,\" DeSantis said.",

        "news": "Nearly one in four people may not get Covid-19 vaccines until at least 2022 because rich countries with less than 15% of the global population have reserved 51% of the doses of the most promising vaccines, researchers said. Low- and middle-income countries - home to more than 85% of the world’s population - would have to share the remainder, said researchers from the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health in the US. An effective response to the pandemic requires high-income countries \"to share in an equitable distribution of Covid-19 vaccines across the world\", they wrote. \"The uncertainty over global access to Covid-19 vaccines traces not only to ongoing clinical testing, but also from the failure of governments and vaccine manufacturers to be more transparent and accountable over these arrangements,\" they added. As of 15 November, high-income nations had pre-ordered nearly 7.5bn doses of vaccines from 13 manufacturers, the paper said. This included Japan, Australia and Canada who collectively have more than 1bn doses but accounted for less than 1% of current Covid-19 cases, it said. Even if leading manufacturers’ vaccines reach their projected maximum production capacity, nearly 25% of the world’s population may not get the vaccines for another year or more, according to the paper. The People’s Vaccine Alliance coalition last week said pharmaceutical companies should openly share their technology and intellectual property through the World Health Organization so that more doses can be manufactured. The John Hopkins researchers said WHO’s COVAX Facility could play a key role in ensuring fairer access to approved vaccines but it has only secured 500m doses, far below its target of delivering at least 2bn doses by the end of 2021. Launched in April, the global pact aims to pool funds from wealthier countries and nonprofits to accelerate the development and manufacture of Covid-19 vaccines and distribute them equitably around the world. It has so far secured half of the funding it needs and the US and Russia - key players in vaccine development and manufacture - have not joined, the Johns Hopkins study said.",
